## *Prochlorococcus* culturing {.unnumbered}

Three xenic cultures of *P. marinus* were obtained from Bigelow Labs, NCMA
Maine, US (REFERENCE). MED4 (CCMP1986) is from High Light-adapted (HLI) clade; SS120
(CCMP1375) is from Low Light-adapted (LLIII) clade; and MIT9313 (CCMP2773)
is from Low Light-adapted (LLIV) clade. Cultures were
maintained in incubators set to 22°C with a light/dark cycle of 12 h, with illumination from XXXXX. The PAR level for maintenance cultures reflected  Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) in the source
niche of the ecotype; MED4, of 160 µmol photons m^-2^ s^-1^; SS120 and
MIT9313 at 30 µmol photons m^-2^ s^-1^. To maintain active growth all strains were
transferred weekly with XX to YY dilution with Pro99 media
[@mooreCulturingMarineCyanobacterium2007] prepared with autoclaved artificial
seawater (National
Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) protocol by combining salt
solution I and salt solution II using the enriched artificial seawater
(ESAW) recipe.  REPLACe with CITATION OF NCMA protocol)XXXX

## Experimental design using bioreactor control of light and [O~2~] {.unnumbered}

Controlled growth experiments were performed using PSI Multicultivators (Figure \@ref(fig:LabeledMC); MCMIX-OD orMC1000-OD, Brno, Czech Republic ).  Each multicultivator individually controls 8 tubes at a common temperature of 22°C.  Each tube containing 70 mL of Pro99 media was inoculated with 10 mL of growing maintenance culture. In a factorial matrix design, each tube was then subject to an individual combination of sinusoidal photoperiod (4, 8, 12, 16  h);  reaching a peak PAR (30, 90, 180 µmol photons m^-2^ s^-1^), with defined spectral bandwidth (AA, BB, CC, DD nm).  [O~2~] levels (2.5 µM, 25 µM, 250 µM) were imposed by bubbling tubes with varying ratios of air and
Nitrogen (N~2~), with consistent 0.05% of Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~)
gas, delivered through a 0.2 μm sterile microfilter via a G400 gas mixing system XXXXGIVE SOURCEXXXX. [O~2~] in situ was verified using oxygen optodes (PyroScience,
Germany) inserted into tubes for
real-time measurements, with a temperature probe in
the aquarium of the bioreactor to correct [O~2~] measures for temperature
fluctuations. In addition, the Pyroscience software corrected [O~2~] based on the
salinity of the media (32 ppt). The flow rate of the gas mixture was controlled, but variations in bubbling speed, PAR and culture density affected the [O~2~] achieved in each tube. A low [O~2~] of 0.5 µM - 5 µM (reported as 2.5 µM hereafter),  was achieved by sparging with a gas mixture containing 99.95% N~2~ and 0.05%
CO~2~. An intermediate [O~2~] of 10 - 25 µM (reported hereafter as 25 µM) was achieved by sparging with a gas mixture containing 98.95% N~2~, 0.05% CO~2~ and 1% O~2~. A high O~2~ of 200 µM - 280 µM (reported hereafter as 250 µM) was achieved by sparging with lab air (78% N~2~, 21% O~2~, 1% Ar and 0.05% CO~2~).

The full crossing of all factor levels would yield 4 x 3 x 4 x 3 = 144 treatments, x 3 strains for 432 possible combinations. Consistent absence of growth of some strains under some levels of photoperiod, PAR, or [O~2~] meant we completed 291 growth factor treatment combinations. 

In situ XXXXItalicsXXX measurements of Optical Density (OD) 680 nm, a proxy for cell suspension density, cell size dependent scatter and cell chlorophyll content;  and OD 720 nm, a proxy for cell suspension density and cell size dependent scatter, were recorded every 5 minutes over least 8 to 14 days,  depending on the
duration of the lag phase, if any. All data from the Multicultivator were saved
as comma separated values file  (CITATION of FILES LOCATION).

PAR of 180, 90 or 30 µmol photons m^-2^ s^-1^, and spectral wavebands (white LED
full spectrum, 660 nm, 530 nm, and 450 nm) were chosen to approximate light
levels and spectral colors spanning the vertical ocean water column, from
near-surface to the lower euphotic zone depths. Photoperiods were chosen to approximate diel cycles characteristic of current and hypothetical future
niches of *P. marinus*; 16 h represents
temperate (45°N) summer at the ocean surface; 12 h for equatorial (0°N)
ocean surface or temperate (45°N) spring and fall ocean surface or
temperate (45°N) summer at deeper ocean depths; 8 h for temperate (45°N)
winter at the surface or at temperate (45°N) spring and fall at depth
and equatorial (0°N) deep ocean depths; and 4 h for temperate (45°N)
winter or deep ocean depths during temperate (45°N) spring and fall.

## Data management and analysis {.unnumbered}

%%%%%% Taken from my thesis word for word, need to reword and shorten %%%%

Data from the Multicultivators were imported into R-Studio for data
management, growth rate calculations, statistics, and generation of
figures with the `ggplot2` package [@R-tidyverse]. The chlorophyll proxy
optical density (OD680 - OD720) or ΔOD was used to determine the growth
rate for each condition. We used a rolling mean from the RStudio `zoo`
package [@R-zoo] to calculate the average ΔOD data over a 1-hour window.
This was done to prevent extraneous data points from affecting the
growth rate estimates. A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
[@bellaviaLevenbergMarquardtMethod2018] modification of the non-linear
least squares fit equation using the R package `minpack.lm`
[@R-minpack.lm] was used to calculate growth rate (µ) using the logistic
equation \@ref(eq:GrowthRate):

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  µ = \frac{ΔOD_{max} × ΔOD_{min} × exp^{(µ × t)}}{ΔOD_{max} + (ΔOD_{min} × exp^{((µ × t) - 1)})}
  (\#eq:GrowthRate)
\end{equation}
```
where ΔOD~max~ is maximum ΔOD, ΔOD~min~ is minimum ΔOD, t is time
duration over the growth trajectory. 

## Generalized additive model {.unnumbered}

%%%%%% Taken from my thesis word for word, need to reword and shorten %%%%

A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was applied to examine the
relationship between the chlorophyll proxy (ΔOD) growth rate across the
blue spectral waveband, photoperiod and PAR levels for each *P.marinus*
ecotype in this study. The gam function from the R package `mgcv`
[@R-mgcv] was used to model the growth rate with smoothing terms to
indicate the 90, 50 and 10% quantiles. Only data below a standard error
tolerance of 30% of the fit was used in the model. Because of time
limitations, we were unable to conduct sufficient growth response
experiments for all the other spectral wavebands, except for the blue,
to fulfill the input requirements for the GAM. Therefore, our priority
was on studying the effect of blue light on growth trends, considering
that blue light is the most ecologically relevant spectral waveband for
deep ocean niches.
