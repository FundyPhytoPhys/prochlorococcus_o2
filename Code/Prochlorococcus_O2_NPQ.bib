  abstract = {Freshwater cyanobacterium Pseudanabaena galeata were cultured in chambers under artificially generated pressures, which correspond to the hydrostatic pressures at deep water. Variations occurred in gas vesicles volume, and buoyancy state of cells under those conditions were analyzed at different time intervals (5\,min, 1 day, and 5 days). Variations in gas vesicles morphology of cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy images. Settling velocity (Vs) of cells which governs the buoyancy was observed with the aid of a modified optical microscope. Moreover, effects of the prolonged pressure on cell ballast composition (protein and polysaccharides) were examined. Elevated pressure conditions reduced the cell ballast and caused a complete disappearance of gas vesicles in Pseudanabaena galeata cells. Hence cyanobacteria cells were not able to float within the study period. Observations and findings of the study indicate the potential application of hydrostatic pressure, which naturally occurred in hypolimnion of lakes, to inhibit the re-suspension of cyanobacteria cells.},

  abstract = {FtsH is a membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloprotease complex found in prokaryotes and organelles of eukaryotic cells. It consists of one or two trans-membrane helices at its amino-terminus, a highly conserved ATPase domain, which relates it to the AAA protein family, and a zinc-binding domain towards its carboxy-terminus that serves as the proteolytic site. Most bacteria contain a single FtsH gene, but the cyanobacterium Synechocystis has four. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 12 genes encoding FtsH proteins, nine of them can be targeted to chloroplasts, whereas the other three are mitochondrial. Chloroplast FtsH protease is located in the thylakoid membrane, where it forms complexes, most likely hexamers, whose ATPase and proteolytic domains are exposed to the stroma. It is involved in the degradation of the D1 protein of photosystem II reaction centre during its repair from photoinhibition, as well as in the degradation of unassembled proteins in the thylakoid and the stroma. In Arabidopsis, FtsH2 is the most abundant isomer, followed by FtsH5, 8 and 1. This hierarchy is well reflected in the severity of the variegated phenotype of mutants in these genes.},

Detailed arrangement of pigments within the supercomplex, as well as molecular interactions between PSI and IsiA and among IsiAs, were resolved. Time-resolved fluorescence spectra of the PSI--IsiA supercomplex showed clear excitation-energy transfer from IsiA to PSI, strongly indicating that IsiA functions as an~energy donor, but not an~energy quencher, in the supercomplex.

Uncultivated lineages of these picocyanobacteria also thrive in the dimly illuminated upper part of oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs), where an important portion of ocean nitrogen (N) loss takes place via denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation. Recent metagenomic studies revealed that ODZ Prochlorococcus have the genetic potential for using different N forms, including nitrate and nitrite, uncommon N sources for Prochlorococcus, but common for Synechococcus. To determine which N sources ODZ picocyanobacteria are actually using in nature, the cellular 15N natural abundance ({$\delta$}15N) and assimilation rates of different N compounds were determined using cell sorting by flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. The natural {$\delta$}15N of the ODZ Prochlorococcus varied from -4.0‰ to 13.0‰ (n = 9), with 50\% of the values in the range of -2.1--2.6‰. While the highest values suggest nitrate use, most observations indicate the use of nitrite, ammonium, or a mixture of N sources. Meanwhile, incubation experiments revealed potential assimilation rates of ammonium and urea in the same order of magnitude as that expected for total N in several environments including ODZs, whereas rates of nitrite and nitrate assimilation were very low. Our results thus indicate that reduced forms of N and nitrite are the dominant sources for ODZ picocyanobacteria, although nitrate might be important on some occasions. ODZ picocyanobacteria might thus represent potential competitors with anammox bacteria for ammonium and nitrite, with ammonia-oxidizing archaea for ammonium, and with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria for nitrite.},

Cyanobacterial FDPs function as hetero- and homodimers and are involved in the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Whilst Flv2 and Flv4 proteins are limited to specific cyanobacterial species ({$\beta$}-cyanobacteria) and function in photoprotection of Photosystem II, Flv1 and Flv3 proteins, functioning in the ``Mehler-like'' reaction and safeguarding Photosystem I under fluctuating light conditions, occur in nearly all cyanobacteria and additionally in green algae, mosses and lycophytes. Filamentous cyanobacteria have additional FDPs in heterocyst cells, ensuring a microaerobic environment for the function of the nitrogenase enzyme under the light. Here, the evolution, occurrence and functional mechanisms of various FDPs in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms are discussed.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacterial flavodiiron proteins (FDPs; A-type flavoprotein, Flv) comprise, besides the {$\beta$}-lactamase--like and flavodoxin domains typical for all FDPs, an extra NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase module and thus differ from FDPs in other Bacteria and Archaea. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has four genes encoding the FDPs. Flv1 and Flv3 function as an NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase, donating electrons directly to O2 without production of reactive oxygen species. Here we show that the Flv1 and Flv3 proteins are crucial for cyanobacteria under fluctuating light, a typical light condition in aquatic environments. Under constant-light conditions, regardless of light intensity, the Flv1 and Flv3 proteins are dispensable. In contrast, under fluctuating light conditions, the growth and photosynthesis of the {$\Delta$}flv1(A) and/or {$\Delta$}flv3(A) mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 become arrested, resulting in cell death in the most severe cases. This reaction is mainly caused by malfunction of photosystem I and oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species generated during abrupt short-term increases in light intensity. Unlike higher plants that lack the FDPs and use the Proton Gradient Regulation 5 to safeguard photosystem I, the cyanobacterial homolog of Proton Gradient Regulation 5 is shown not to be crucial for growth under fluctuating light. Instead, the unique Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer maintains the redox balance of the electron transfer chain in cyanobacteria and provides protection for photosystem I under fluctuating growth light. Evolution of unique cyanobacterial FDPs is discussed as a prerequisite for the development of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {One of the outstanding questions concerning the early Earth is how ancient phototrophs made the evolutionary transition from anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesis, which resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. We have previously demonstrated that reaction centers from anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can be modified to bind a redox-active Mn cofactor, thus gaining a key functional feature of photosystem II, which contains the site for water oxidation in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants [Thielges M, et al. (2005)               Biochemistry               44:7389--7394]. In this paper, the Mn-binding reaction centers are shown to have a light-driven enzymatic function; namely, the ability to convert superoxide into molecular oxygen. This activity has a relatively high efficiency with a               k               cat               of approximately 1~s               -1               that is significantly larger than typically observed for designed enzymes, and a               K               m               of 35--40~{$\mu$}M that is comparable to the value of 50~{$\mu$}M for Mn-superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes a similar reaction. Unlike wild-type reaction centers, the highly oxidizing reaction centers are not stable in the light unless they have a bound Mn. The stability and enzymatic ability of this type of Mn-binding reaction centers would have provided primitive phototrophs with an environmental advantage before the evolution of organisms with a more complex Mn               4               Ca cluster needed to perform the multielectron reactions required to oxidize water.},

Recent advances, however, indicate that energy dissipation in green algae is controlled by photoreceptors activated by blue and UV-B light, and new molecular links have been established between photoreception and photoprotection.},

(2002) Eur. J. Biochem.269, 2353--2358]. To understand the spread of the taxa in which PSII interacts with SQDG, especially in cyanobacteria, we produced a mutant defective in the putative sqdB gene responsible for SQDG synthesis from two cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC7942. The mutant of PCC6803, designated SD1, lacked SQDG synthetic ability and required SQDG supplementation for its growth. After transfer from SQDG-supplemented to SQDG-free conditions, SD1 showed decreased net photosynthetic and PSII activities on a chlorophyll (Chl) basis with a decrease in the SQDG content. Moreover, the sensitivity of PSII activity to 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea and atrazine was increased in SD1. However, SD1 maintained normal amounts of cytochrome b559 and D1 protein (the subunits comprising the PSII complex) on a Chl basis, indicating that the PSII complex content changed little, irrespective of a decrease in the SQDG content. These results suggest that the role of SQDG is the conservation of the PSII properties in PCC6803, consistent with the results obtained with C. reinhardtii. In contrast, the SQDG-null mutant of PCC7942 showed the normal level of PSII activity with little effect on its sensitivity to PSII herbicides. Therefore, the difference in the SQDG requirement for PSII is species-specific in cyanobacteria; this could be of use when investigating the molecular evolution of the PSII complex.},

Light-induced damage is targetted mainly to Photosystem II and leads to inactivation of electron transport and subsequent oxidative damage of the reaction centre, in particular to the D1 protein. Inactivation and protein damage can be induced by two different mechanisms, either from the acceptor side or from donor side of P680. The damaged D1 protein is triggered for degradation and digested by at least one serine-type proteinase that is tightly associated with the Photosystem II complex itself. The damaged Photosystem II complex dissociates from the light-harvesting antenna and migrates from appressed to non-appressed thylakoid regions where a new D1 protein is co-translationally inserted into the partially disassembled Photosystem II complex. D1 protein phosphorylation probably allows for coordinated biodegradation and biosynthesis of the D1 protein. After religation of cofactors and assembly of subunits, the repaired Photosystem II complex can again be found in the appressed membrane regions. Various protective mechanisms and an efficient repair cycle of Photosystem II allow plants to survive light stress.},

However, environmental sequence data suggest that some uncultivated lineages may have acquired this capacity. Here we report that uncultivated low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus from the nutrient-rich, low-light, anoxic marine zone (AMZ) of the eastern tropical South Pacific have the genetic potential for nitrate uptake and assimilation. All genes involved in this trait were found syntenic with those present in marine Synechococcus. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses also suggest that these genes have not been aquired recently, but perhaps were retained from a common ancestor, highlighting the basal characteristics of the AMZ lineages within Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria probably exhibit the widest range of diversity in growth habitats of all photosynthetic organisms. They are found in cold and hot, alkaline and acidic, marine, freshwater, saline, terrestrial, and symbiotic environments. In addition to this, they originated on earth at least 2.5 billion years ago and have evolved through periods of dramatic O2 increases, CO2 declines, and temperature changes. One of the key problems they have faced through evolution and in their current environments is the capture of CO2 and its efficient use by Rubisco in photosynthesis. A central response to this challenge has been the development of a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) that can be adapted to various environmental limitations. There are two primary functional elements of this CCM. Firstly, the containment of Rubisco in carboxysome protein microbodies within the cell (the sites of CO2 elevation), and, secondly, the presence of several inorganic carbon (Ci) transporters that deliver {\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{HCO\}\_\{3\}\^{}\{\{-\}\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\} intracellularly. Cyanobacteria show both species adaptation and acclimation of this mechanism. Between species, there are differences in the suites of Ci transporters in each genome, the nature of the carboxysome structures and the functional roles of carbonic anhydrases. Within a species, different CCM activities can be induced depending on the Ci availability in the environment. This acclimation is largely based on the induction of multiple Ci transporters with different affinities and specificities for either CO2 or {\textbackslash}batchmode {\textbackslash}documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}usepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}pagestyle\{empty\} {\textbackslash}begin\{document\} {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathrm\{HCO\}\_\{3\}\^{}\{\{-\}\}{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}end\{document\} as substrates.

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria dominate the world's oceans where iron is often barely detectable. One manifestation of low iron adaptation in the oligotrophic marine environment is a decrease in levels of iron-rich photosynthetic components, including the reaction center of photosystem I and the cytochrome b6f complex [R.F. Strzepek and P.J. Harrison, Photosynthetic architecture differs in coastal and oceanic diatoms, Nature 431 (2004) 689--692.]. These thylakoid membrane components have well characterised roles in linear and cyclic photosynthetic electron transport and their low abundance creates potential impediments to photosynthetic function. Here we show that the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus WH8102 exhibits significant alternative electron flow to O2, a potential adaptation to the low iron environment in oligotrophic oceans. This alternative electron flow appears to extract electrons from the intersystem electron transport chain, prior to photosystem I. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that a propyl gallate-sensitive oxidase mediates this flow of electrons to oxygen, which in turn alleviates excessive photosystem II excitation pressure that can often occur even at relatively low irradiance. These findings are also discussed in the context of satisfying the energetic requirements of the cell when photosystem I abundance is low. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Consideration is given as to how electron fluxes through photosystem I (PSI), using absorption spectroscopy, and through photosystem II (PSII), using chlorophyll fluorescence analyses, can be estimated in vivo. Measurements of light-induced electrochromic shifts using absorption spectroscopy provide a means of analyzing the proton fluxes across the thylakoid membranes in vivo. Regulation of these electron and proton fluxes is required for the thylakoids to meet the fluctuating metabolic demands of the cell. Chloroplasts exhibit a wide and flexible range of mechanisms to regulate electron and proton fluxes that enable chloroplasts to match light use for ATP and reductant production with the prevailing metabolic requirements. Non-invasive probing of electron fluxes through PSI and PSII, and proton fluxes across the thylakoid membranes can provide insights into the operation of such regulatory processes in vivo.},

Powered by light, this enzyme catalyses the chemically and thermodynamically demanding reaction of water splitting. In so doing, it releases dioxygen into the atmosphere and provides the reducing equivalents required for the conversion of CO2 into the organic molecules of life. Recently, a fully refined structure of a 700 kDa cyanobacterial dimeric PSII complex was elucidated by X-ray crystallography which gave organizational and structural details of the 19 subunits (16 intrinsic and three extrinsic) which make up each monomer and provided information about the position and protein environments of 57 different cofactors. The water-splitting site was revealed as a cluster of four Mn ions and a Ca2+ ion surrounded by amino acid side chains, of which six or seven form direct ligands to the metals. The metal cluster was modelled as a cubane-like structure composed of three Mn ions and the Ca2+ linked by oxo-bonds with the fourth Mn attached to the cubane via one of its oxygens. The overall structure of the catalytic site is providing a framework to develop a mechanistic scheme for the water-splitting process, knowledge which could have significant implications for mimicking the reaction in an artificial chemical system.},

We used the mild detergent n-dodecyl {$\beta$} D-maltopyranoside to solubilize the thylakoid membranes. Gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was then used to separate the complexes of the photosynthetic apparatus. The proteins and the pigments were identified by mass spectrometry. Protein complexes were characterized biochemically, and the distribution of Chl a2 and Chl b2 was determined. The photosynthetic apparatus was shown as supercomplexes formed by Photosystem II dimers with up to eight PcbB proteins; Photosystem I was present as trimers. A heterogeneous distribution of pigments was shown using sucrose gradient-enriched fractions with ratios of [Chl b2]/[Chl a2] of 2.16 {\textpm} 0.13, 1.86 {\textpm} 0.08, and 2.61 {\textpm} 0.07, for Photosystem I, Photosystem II, and PcbB, respectively. These ratios of Chl b/a are without precedent in organisms with oxygenic photosynthesis. Diaphorase activity was measured in the fractions of the sucrose gradient. Gel electrophoresis, immunodetection, and mass spectrometry were used to conclude that the commonly soluble protein ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) is a membrane-anchored protein (probably associated to cytochrome b6f complex) in the low-light adapted Prochlorococcus marinus MIT9313.},

Marine phytoplankton communities appear sensitive to climate change, yet understanding of how individual species may respond to anthropogenic climate change remains limited. Here, using historical environmental and phytoplankton observations, we characterize the realized ecological niches for 87 North Atlantic diatom and dinoflagellate taxa and project changes in species biogeography between mean historical (1951--2000) and future (2051--2100) ocean conditions. We find that the central positions of the core range of 74\% of taxa shift poleward at a median rate of 12.9 km per decade (km{$\cdot$}dec-1), and 90\% of taxa shift eastward at a median rate of 42.7 km{$\cdot$}dec-1. The poleward shift is faster than previously reported for marine taxa, and the predominance of longitudinal shifts is driven by dynamic changes in multiple environmental drivers, rather than a strictly poleward, temperature-driven redistribution of ocean habitats. A century of climate change significantly shuffles community composition by a basin-wide median value of 16\%, compared with seasonal variations of 46\%. The North Atlantic phytoplankton community appears poised for marked shift and shuffle, which may have broad effects on food webs and biogeochemical cycles.},

With a combined global population of about 2.7\,{\texttimes}\,1028 cells, they numerically dominate bacterioplankton communities in oligotrophic ocean gyres and yet they have never been grown together in vitro. Here we describe co-cultures of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 isolates representing both high- and low-light adapted clades. We examined: (1) the influence of Prochlorococcus on the growth of SAR11 and vice-versa, (2) whether Prochlorococcus can meet specific nutrient requirements of SAR11, and (3) how co-culture dynamics vary when Prochlorococcus is grown with SAR11 compared with sympatric copiotrophic bacteria. SAR11 grew 15--70\% faster in co-culture with Prochlorococcus, while the growth of the latter was unaffected. When Prochlorococcus populations entered stationary phase, this commensal relationship rapidly became amensal, as SAR11 abundances decreased dramatically. In parallel experiments with copiotrophic bacteria; however, the heterotrophic partner increased in abundance as Prochlorococcus densities leveled off. The presence of Prochlorococcus was able to meet SAR11's central requirement for organic carbon, but not reduced sulfur. Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313, but not MED4, could meet the unique glycine requirement of SAR11, which could be due to the production and release of glycine betaine by MIT9313, as supported by comparative genomic evidence. Our findings also suggest, but do not confirm, that Prochlorococcus MIT9313 may compete with SAR11 for the uptake of 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). To give our results an ecological context, we assessed the relative contribution of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 genome equivalents to those of identifiable bacteria and archaea in over 800 marine metagenomes. At many locations, more than half of the identifiable genome equivalents in the euphotic zone belonged to Prochlorococcus and SAR11 -- highlighting the biogeochemical potential of these two groups.},

  abstract = {We assembled a dataset of 14 C-based productivity measurements to understand the critical variables required for accurate assessment of daily depth-integrated phytoplankton carbon fixation (PPeu) from measurements of sea surface pigment concentrations (Csat). From this dataset, we developed a light-dependent, depth-resolved model for carbon fixation (VGPM) that partitions environmental factors affecting primary production into those that influence the relative vertical distribution of primary production (Pz) and those that control the optimal assimilation efficiency of the productivity profile (PB opt). The VGPM accounted for 79\% of the observed variability in Pz and 86\% of the variability in PPeu by using measured values of PB opt. Our results indicate that the accuracy of productivity algorithms in estimating PPeu is dependent primarily upon the ability to accurately represent variability in PB opt. We developed a temperature-dependent PB opt model that was used in conjunction with monthly climatological images of Csat, sea surface temperature, and cloud-corrected estimates of surface irradiance to calculate a global annual phytoplankton carbon fixation (PPannu) rate of 43.5 Pg C yr-1. The geographical distribution of PPannu was distinctly different than results from previous models. Our results illustrate the importance of focusing PB opt model development on temporal and spatial, rather than the vertical, variability.},

The proposed method relies on a control of the accuracy level, and imposes an improvement of function approximations when the accuracy is detected to be too low to proceed with the optimization process. We prove global and local convergence and complexity of our procedure and show encouraging numerical results on test problems arising in data assimilation and machine learning.},

  abstract = {The deepening of mixed layer and ensuing changes in optical and physicochemical properties of euphotic zone can influence phytoplankton community dynamics in the northeastern Arabian Sea during winter monsoon. The response of picophytoplankton community to such changes during winter convective mixing is not well understood. Herein, we have compared variations in the picophytoplankton community structure during early (November--December 2012), peak (end-January 2014) and late (mid-February 2015) winter monsoon from three separate cruises in the southern northeastern Arabian Sea. The higher Synechococcus abundance owing to entrainment of nutrients in mixed layer was observed during peak winter monsoon, while the concomitant changes in nitrate concentration, light and oxygen environment restricted Prochlorococcus growth resulting in lower abundance during the same period. This highlights the diverse responses of picophytoplankton groups to physicochemical changes of water column during winter convective mixing. The divinyl chlorophyll b/a ratio (marker for Prochlorococcus ecotypes) indicated prevalence of one low-light adapted ecotype (sensitive to light shock) in sub-surface water, one high-light adapted ecotype in surface water during early winter monsoon and both disappeared during intense mixing period in peak winter monsoon. Subsequently, a distinct low-light adapted ecotype, capable to tolerate light shock, was noticed during late winter monsoon and we argue that this ecotype is introduced to southern northeastern Arabian Sea through advection from north by sub-surface circulation. The total picophytoplankton biomass available to microbial loop is restored during late winter monsoon, when stratification begins, with a higher abundance of Synechococcus and the re-occurrence of Prochlorococcus population in the region. These inferences indicate that variability in picophytoplankton community structure and their contribution to the microbial loop are driven by convective mixing and advection, which in turn influence ecosystem functioning and trophodynamics of the southern northeastern Arabian Sea.},

  abstract = {Although most phycologists use natural seawater for culturing marine species, artificial media continue to play important roles in overcoming problems of supply and seasonal variability in the quality of natural seawater and also for experiments involving manipulation of micro- and macronutrients. Several artificial media have been developed over the last 90 years; enriched seawater, artificial water (ESAW) is among the more popular recipes. ESAW has the advantage of an ionic balance that is somewhat closer to that of normal seawater. The original paper compared the growth of 83 strains of microalgae in natural seawater (ESNW) versus ESAW and determined that 23\% grew more poorly in the artificial water. Since 1980, however, the composition of ESAW, as used by the original authors, has changed considerably. In particular, the added forms of phosphate, iron, and silicate have been changed and the trace metal mixture has been altered to include nickel, molybdenum, and selenium. We tested whether these changes improved the ability of the artificial medium to grow previously difficult to grow phytoplankton species. To test this, we selected eight species that had been shown to grow better in ESNW than in ESAW and compared their growth again, using the currently used recipe with all the above modifications. For all but one species (Apedinella spinifera), growth rate and final yield was no different between the media but in one case (Emiliania huxleyi) was slightly higher in ESAW. No differences in cell morphology or volume were found in any case. We conclude that changes to the enrichment portion of the recipe have significantly improved this artificial seawater medium and that it can be used to grow an even wider range of coastal and open ocean species.},

We analyzed the cellular carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents of Prochlorococcus (MED4) and Synechococcus (WH8103 and WH8012) under nutrient-replete and P-starved conditions. Under nutrient-replete conditions, C, N, and P quotas (femtogram cell21) of the three strains were 46 {\textpm} 4, 9.4 {\textpm} 0.9, and 1.0 {\textpm} 0.2 for MED4; 92 {\textpm} 13, 20 6 3, and 1.8 {\textpm} 0.1 for WH8012; and 213 {\textpm} 7, 50 {\textpm} 2, 3.3 {\textpm} 0.5 for WH8103. In P-limited cultures, they were 61 {\textpm} 2, 9.6 {\textpm} 0.1, and 0.3 {\textpm} 0.1 for MED4; 132 {\textpm} 6, 21 {\textpm} 2, and 0.5 {\textpm} 0.2 for WH8012; and 244 {\textpm} 21, 40 {\textpm} 4, and 0.8 {\textpm} 0.01 for WH8103. P limitation had no effect on the N cell quota of MED4 and WH8012 but reduced the N content of WH8103. The cellular C quota was consistently higher in P-limited than in nutrient-replete cultures. All three strains had higher C: P and N: P ratios than the Redfield ratio under both nutrient-replete and P-limited conditions. The C:N molar ratios ranged 5--5.7 in replete cultures and 7.1--7.5 in P-limited cultures; C: P ranged 121--165 in the replete cultures and 464--779 under P limitation; N: P ranged 21--33 in the replete cultures and 59--109 under P limitation. Our results suggest that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus may have relatively low P requirements in the field, and thus the particulate organic matter they produce would differ from the Redfield ratio (106C : 16N : 1P) often assumed for the production of new particulate organic matter in the sea.},

Here we examine variation in the ability to use nitrate across hundreds of Prochlorococcus genomes to better understand the modes of evolution influencing intraspecific allocation of ecologically important functions. Nitrate assimilation genes are absent in basal lineages but occur at an intermediate frequency that is randomly distributed within recently emerged clades. The distribution of nitrate assimilation genes within clades appears largely governed by vertical inheritance, gene loss, and homologous recombination. By mapping this process onto a model of Prochlorococcus' macroevolution, we propose that niche-constructing adaptive radiations and subsequent niche partitioning set the stage for loss of nitrate assimilation genes from basal lineages as they specialized to lower light levels. Retention of these genes in recently emerged lineages has likely been facilitated by selection as they sequentially partitioned into niches where nitrate assimilation conferred a fitness benefit.},

Comparative genomics of cultivated isolates has helped address questions regarding patterns of evolution and diversity among microbes, but the fraction that can be cultivated is miniscule compared to the diversity in the wild.

Many of these uncultivated single cell genomes are derived from samples obtained on GEOTRACES cruises and at well-studied oceanographic stations, each with extensive suites of physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

The pcb genes, encoding the major chlorophyll-binding, light-harvesting antenna proteins in this genus, are present in multiple copies in low-light strains but as a single copy in high-light strains. The basis of this differentiation, however, has remained obscure. Here we show that the moderate low-light-adapted strain Prochlorococcus sp. MIT 9313 has one iron-stress-induced pcb gene encoding an antenna protein serving photosystem I (PSI)--comparable to isiA genes from cyanobacteria--and a constitutively expressed pcb gene encoding a photosystem II (PSII) antenna protein. By comparison, the very low-light-adapted strain SS120 has seven pcb genes encoding constitutive PSI and PSII antennae, plus one PSI iron-regulated pcb gene, whereas the high-light-adapted strain MED4 has only a constitutive PSII antenna. Thus, it seems that the adaptation of Prochlorococcus to low light environments has triggered a multiplication and specialization of Pcb proteins comparable to that found for Cab proteins in plants and green algae.},

  abstract = {Diverse microbes release membrane-bound extracellular vesicles from their outer surfaces into the surrounding environment. Vesicles are found in numerous habitats including the oceans, where they likely have a variety of functional roles in microbial ecosystems. Extracellular vesicles are known to contain a range of biomolecules including DNA, but the frequency with which DNA is packaged in vesicles is unknown. Here, we examine the quantity and distribution of DNA associated with vesicles released from five different bacteria. The average quantity of double-stranded DNA and size distribution of DNA fragments released within vesicles varies among different taxa. Although some vesicles contain sufficient DNA to be visible following staining with the SYBR fluorescent DNA dyes typically used to enumerate viruses, this represents only a small proportion ({$<$}0.01--1\%) of vesicles. Thus DNA is packaged heterogeneously within vesicle populations, and it appears that vesicles are likely to be a minor component of SYBR-visible particles in natural sea water compared with viruses. Consistent with this hypothesis, chloroform treatment of coastal and offshore seawater samples reveals that vesicles increase epifluorescence-based particle (viral) counts by less than an order of magnitude and their impact is variable in space and time.},

While vesicles are abundant in the oceans, their functions, both for cells themselves and the emergent ecosystem, remain a mystery. To better characterize these particles -- a prerequisite for determining function -- we analysed the lipid, protein, and metabolite content of vesicles produced by the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. We show that Prochlorococcus exports a diverse array of cellular compounds into the surrounding seawater enclosed within discrete vesicles. Vesicles produced by two different strains contain some materials in common, but also display numerous strain-specific differences, reflecting functional complexity within vesicle populations. The vesicles contain active enzymes, indicating that they can mediate extracellular biogeochemical reactions in the ocean. We further demonstrate that vesicles from Prochlorococcus and other bacteria associate with diverse microbes including the most abundant marine bacterium, Pelagibacter. Together, our data point toward hypotheses concerning the functional roles of vesicles in marine ecosystems including, but not limited to, possibly mediating energy and nutrient transfers, catalysing extracellular biochemical reactions, and mitigating toxicity of reactive oxygen species.},

  abstract = {Seasonal oxygen structure and utilization in the Sargasso Sea are characterized using nine profiling floats with oxygen 2021 sensors (years 2005--2008), deployed in an Eighteen Degree Water (EDW) experiment (CLIMODE). During autumn-winter when the mixed layer is deepening, oxygen increases from the surface to the base of the EDW at 400 m. During spring-summer, oxygen decreases except between the seasonal pycnocline and compensation depth, creating the seasonal shallow oxygen maximum layer (SOMax) with oxygen production of 0.04 {$\mu$}mol kg-1{$\cdot$}day-1. In the underlying seasonal oxygen minimum (SOMin), the oxygen utilization rate (OUR) is 0.10 {$\mu$}mol kg-1{$\cdot$}day-1, decreasing with depth to 0.04 {$\mu$}mol kg-1{$\cdot$}day-1 in the EDW. Remineralization in May to August is double that of August to November. The Sargasso Sea is a net carbon producer; estimated annual export production from the top 100--250 m is 2.9 mol C m-2 and from the top 400 m is 4.2 mol C m-2. Below the EDW, oxygen decreases seasonally at the same time as in the EDW, indicating remineralization down to 700 m. However, on isopycnals in this deeper layer, oxygen increases during May to September, likely due to lateral advection from nonlocal surface outcrops. Summer shoaling of these isopycnals creates this paradox. The complex vertical oxygen structure in the upper 200 m enables important vertical diffusive flux that modifies the OUR calculated from oxygen change. Ignoring mixing underestimates maximum remineralization by 19\% and underestimates maximum net production by 88\%. However, vertical mixing is negligible in the deeper layers, so the associated total integrated remineralization error is 5\%--9\%.},

  abstract = {Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, 1) and its derivatives: pyridoxal (2), pyridoxal 5-phosphate (3) and pyridoxamine (4) are important natural compounds involved in numerous biological functions. Pyridoxine appears to play a role in the resistance of the filamentous fungus Cercospora nicotianae to its own abundantly produced strong photosensitizer of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2), cercosporin. We measured the rate constants (kq) for the quenching of 1O2 phosphorescence by 1--4 in D2O. The respective total (physical and chemical quenching) kq values are: 5.5 {\texttimes} 107M-1 s-1 for 1; 7.5 {\texttimes} 107M-1 s-1 for 2, 6.2 {\texttimes}107M-1 s-1 for 3 and 7.5 {\texttimes} 107M-1 s-1 for 4, all measured at pD 6.2. The quenching efficacy increased up to five times in alkaline solutions and decreased {$\sim$}10 times in ethanol. Significant contribution to total quenching by chemical reaction(s) is suggested by the degradation of all the vitamin derivatives by 1O2, which was observed as declining absorption of the pyridoxine moiety upon aerobic irradiation of RB used to photosensitize 1O2. This photodegradation was completely stopped by azide, a known physical quencher of 1O2. The pyridoxine moiety can also function as a redox quencher for excited cercosporin by forming the cercosporin radical anion, as observed by electron paramagnetic resonance. All B6 vitamers fluoresce upon UV excitation. Compounds 1 and 4 emit fluorescence at 400 nm, compound 2 at 450 nm and compound 3 at 550 nm. The fluorescence intensity of 3 increased {$\sim$}10 times in organic solvents such as ethanol and 1,2-propanediol compared to aqueous solutions, suggesting that fluorescence may be used to image the distribution of 1--4 in Cercospora to understand better the interactions of pyridoxine and 1O2 in the living fungus.},

The spectrum in each channel is analyzed separately by a photodiode array. The use of flash measuring beam and differential detection yields high signal-to-noise ratio (noise level of 2 {$\cdot$} 10--4 in absorbance units per single flash) with negligible actinic effect. The instrument covers a spectral range between 300 and 1050 nm with a spectral resolution of 2.1, 6.4 or 12.8 nm dependent on the type of grating used. The optical design of the instrument enables measuring of the difference spectra during an actinic irradiation of samples with continuous light and/or saturation flashes. The time resolution of the spectrophotometer is limited by the length of Xe flash lamp pulses to 2 ls.},

Here we investigate when superoxide dismutase enzymes (SODs) capable of removing superoxide free radicals evolved and estimate when Cyanobacteria originated. Our Bayesian molecular clocks, calibrated with microfossils, predict that stem Cyanobacteria arose 3300--3600 million years ago. Shortly afterwards, we find phylogenetic evidence that ancestral cyanobacteria used SODs with copper and zinc cofactors (CuZnSOD) during the Archaean. By the Paleoproterozoic, they became genetically capable of using iron, nickel, and manganese as cofactors (FeSOD, NiSOD, and MnSOD respectively). The evolution of NiSOD is particularly intriguing because it corresponds with cyanobacteria's invasion of the open ocean. Our analyses of metalloenzymes dealing with reactive oxygen species (ROS) now demonstrate that marine geochemical records alone may not predict patterns of metal usage by phototrophs from freshwater and terrestrial habitats.},

In addition to a high Chl a--b ratio, ANK mutants had a lower content of photo-oxidizable photosystem I (PSI, Pm), and several parameters indicated a low PSI/PSII ratio. Moreover, simultaneous measurements of Chl fluorescence and P700 indicated a shift of balance between redox poise of the PSII acceptor side and the PSII donor side, with preferential reduction of the plastoquinone pool, resulting in an over reduced PSI acceptor side (high {$\Phi$}NA values). This was the probable reason for PSI inactivation observed in the ANK mutants, but not in WT. In later growth phases, we observed partial relief of ``chlorina symptoms,'' toward WT. Measurements of {$\Delta$}A520 decay confirmed that, in early growth stages, the ANK mutants with low PSI content had a limited capacity to build up the transthylakoid proton gradient ({$\Delta$}pH) needed to trigger non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and to regulate the electron transport by cytochrome b6/f. Later, the increase in the PSI/PSII ratio enabled ANK mutants to reach full NPQ, but neither over reduction of the PSI acceptor side nor PSI photoinactivation due to imbalance between the activity of PSII and PSI was mitigated. Thus, our results support the crucial role of proper regulation of linear electron transport in the protection of PSI against photoinhibition. Moreover, the ANK mutants of wheat showing the dynamic developmental changes in the PSI/PSII ratio are presented here as very useful models for further studies.},

Measurements were made of the cylinder diameter (d) of gas vesicles isolated from seven of the strains. The mean diameter, which varied from 48 to 61 nm, was inversely related to pc, in keeping with the theory of strength of thin-walled rigid cylinders. These measurements extended the range of pc--width relationship of gas vesicles, which can be described by the expression pc l 461(d/nm)N1n53 MPa. pc was correlated with gas vesicle genotype (see the accompanying paper by S.

It remains unclear to what extent ammonium and nitrite oxidation co-occur, either supplying or competing for substrates involved in nitrogen loss in the OMZ core. Assessment of the oxygen (O2) sensitivity of these processes down to the O2 concentrations present in the OMZ core ({$<$}10 nmol{$\cdot$}L-1) is therefore essential for understanding and modeling nitrogen loss in OMZs. We determined rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation in the seasonal OMZ off Concepcion, Chile at manipulated O2 levels between 5 nmol{$\cdot$}L-1 and 20 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}L-1. Rates of both processes were detectable in the low nanomolar range (5--33 nmol{$\cdot$}L-1 O2), but demonstrated a strong dependence on O2 concentrations with apparent half-saturation constants (Kms) of 333 {\textpm} 130 nmol{$\cdot$}L-1 O2 for ammonium oxidation and 778 {\textpm} 168 nmol{$\cdot$}L-1 O2 for nitrite oxidation assuming one-component Michaelis--Menten kinetics. Nitrite oxidation rates, however, were better described with a two-component Michaelis--Menten model, indicating a high-affinity component with a Km of just a few nanomolar. As the communities of ammonium and nitrite oxidizers were similar to other OMZs, these kinetics should apply across OMZ systems. The high O2 affinities imply that ammonium and nitrite oxidation can occur within the OMZ core whenever O2 is supplied, for example, by episodic intrusions. These processes therefore compete with anammox and denitrification for ammonium and nitrite, thereby exerting an important control over nitrogen loss.},

Phytoplankton function and acclimation are driven by catalytic protein complexes that mediate key physiological transformations, including generation of photosynthetic ATP and reductant, and carbon and nitrogen fixation. Quantitation of capacities for these processes allows estimation of rates for key ecosystem processes, and identification of factors limiting primary productivity. We herein present molar quantitations of PSI, PSII, ATP synthase, RuBisCO and the Fe protein of nitrogenase of Trichodesmium collected from the Gulf of Mexico, in comparison to determinations for a range of cyanobacteria growing in culture. Using these measurements, estimates were generated for Trichodesmium capacities for carbon fixation of 1-3.4 g C g chl a(-1) h(-1) and nitrogen fixation of 0.06-0.17 g N g chl a(-1) h(-1), with diel variations in capacities. ATP synthase levels show that ATP synthesis capacity is sufficient to support these levels of carbon and nitrogen fixation, and that ATP synthase levels change over the day in accordance with the ATP demands of nitrogenase and RuBisCO activity. Levels of measured complexes indicate that Trichodesmium manifests n-type diel light acclimation through rapid changes in RuBisCO:PSII, supported by significant investment of cellular nitrogen. The plasticity in the levels and stoichiometry of these core complexes show that changes in the abundance of core protein complexes are an important component of acclimation and regulation of metabolic function by Trichodesmium populations.},

The activity of Flvs have also been observed to form an important catalytic redox loop with water oxidation necessary for preserving photosynthetic electron transport function in cyanobacteria. To determine how these functions may be related, we investigated the kinetic properties of Flv1 and Flv3 from               Synechocystis               sp. PCC 6803. Under an oxygen atmosphere, Flv1 and Flv3 were found to catalyze ORR with either NADH or NADPH as the electron donor. Reaction velocity curves were sigmoidal and Flv binding of NAD(P)H was cooperative. Based on mass spectrometry generated structural models, each Flv assembles as a homodimer with two oxidoreductase domains capable of binding two molecules of NAD(P)H per subunit, and the flavins are arranged to support electron transfer to the diiron sites for oxygen reduction. Titrations with NAD(P)H resulted in reduction of the diiron site without the accumulation of stable, reduced flavin intermediates. Altogether, the results provide new insights on the properties of Flv1 and Flv3 that enable tight control of reactivity for the complete reduction of oxygen to water, and in this capacity help preserve photosynthetic electron transport function.},

For all the cultured species, {$\delta$}13C signatures ranged from -23.5‰ (Imantonia sp.) to -12.3‰ (Nodularia spumigena) in the exponential phase and from -18.8‰ (Amphidinium carterae) to -8.0‰ (Anabaena lemmermannii) in the stationary phase. Three species (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Rhodomonas sp., Heterocapsa triquetra) were also grown under nutrient sufficient and nitrogen or phosphorus deficient conditions. Nitrogen limitation resulted in a more negative {$\delta$}13C signature, whereas no effect could be observed during phosphorus limitation compared to nutrient sufficient conditions. Growth of Prymnesium parvum in two different salinities resulted in a more negative {$\delta$}13C signature in the 26‰-media compared to growth in 7‰-media. Our results show that the carbon isotopic signature of phytoplankton may be affected by salinity, differ among different phytoplankton species, between exponential and stationary phase, as well as between nutrient treatments.},

  abstract = {Stable carbon isotope fractionation (\%) of 7 marine phytoplankton species grown in different irradiance cycles was measured under nutrient-replete conditions at a high light intensity in batch cultures. Compared to experiments under continuous light, all species exhibited a significantly higher instantaneous growth rate (pi),defined as the rate of carbon fixation during the photoperiod, when cultivated at 12:12 h. 16:8h, or 1 8 6 h light:dark (L/D) cycles. Isotopic fractionation by the diatoms Skeletonema costatum, Asterionella glacialis, Thalassiosira punctigera, and Coscinodiscus wailesii (Group I) was 4 to 6 \% lower in a 16:8 h L/Dcycle than under continuous light, which we attribute to differences in pi. In contrast, E, in Phaeodactylum tn'cornutum, Thalassiosira weissflogii, and in the dinoflagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea (Group 11) was largely insensitive to daylength-related differences in instantaneous growth rate. Since other studies have reported growth-rate dependent fractionation under N-limited conditions in P. tricornutum, pi-related effects on fractionation apparently depend on the factor controlling growth rate. We suggest that a general relationship between E, and pi/[C02,,,] may not exist. For 1 species of each group we tested the effect of variable CO2concentration, [COz,,,],on isotopic fractionation. A decrease in [CO2,,,]from ca 26 to 3 pm01 kg-' caused a decrease in E, by less than 3\%0 This indicates that variation in h in response to changes in daylength has a similar or even greater effect on isotopic fractionation than [COz,,,] m some of the species tested.

The high efficiency of algal photosynthesis relies on a~mechanism concentrating CO2 (CCM) at the catalytic site of the carboxylating enzyme RuBisCO, which enhances CO2 fixation2. Although many cellular components involved in the transport and sequestration of inorganic carbon have been identified3,4, how microalgae supply energy to concentrate CO2 against a thermodynamic gradient remains unknown4--6. Here we show that in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the combined action of cyclic electron flow and O2 photoreduction---which depend on PGRL1 and flavodiiron proteins, respectively---generate a low luminal pH that is essential for CCM function. We suggest that luminal protons are used downstream of thylakoid bestrophin-like transporters, probably for the conversion of bicarbonate to CO2. We further establish that an electron flow from chloroplast to mitochondria contributes to energizing non-thylakoid inorganic carbon transporters, probably by supplying ATP. We propose an integrated view of the network supplying energy to the CCM, and describe how algal cells distribute energy from photosynthesis to power different CCM processes. These results suggest a route for the transfer of a functional algal CCM to plants to improve crop productivity.},

Here, we structurally aligned the diverse RNR family by the conserved catalytic barrel to reconstruct the first large-scale phylogeny consisting of 6,779 sequences that unites all extant classes of the RNR family and performed evo-velocity analysis to independently validate our evolutionary model. With a robust phylogeny in-hand, we uncovered a novel, phylogenetically distinct clade that is placed as ancestral to the classes I and II RNRs, which we have termed clade {\O}.

Using the catalytic barrel as a starting point for diversification, we traced the evolutionarily relatedness of insertions and extensions that confer the diversity observed in the RNR family.

  abstract = {Global ocean oxygen loss is projected to persist in the future, but Earth system models (ESMs) have not yet provided a consistent picture of how it will influence the largest oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the tropical Pacific. We examine the change in the Pacific OMZ volume in an ensemble of ESMs from the CMIP6 archive, considering a broad range of oxygen (O2) thresholds relevant to biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems (5--160 {\textmu}mol/kg). Despite OMZ biases in the historical period of the simulations, the ESM ensemble projections consistently fall into three regimes across ESMs: an expansion of low oxygenated waters (+0.8 [0.6, 1.0] {\texttimes} 1016 m3/century for O2 {$\leq$} 120 {\textmu}mol/kg, ESM median and interquartile range); a slight contraction of the OMZ core although more uncertain across ESMs (-0.1 [-0.5, 0.0] {\texttimes} 1016 m3/century for O2 {$\leq$} 20 {\textmu}mol/kg); and at the transition from contraction to expansion regimes, a spatial redistribution but near-zero change in the volume of hypoxic waters (0.0 [-0.3, +0.1] {\texttimes} 1016 m3/century for O2 {$\leq$} 60 {\textmu}mol/kg). Changes in circulation and biology dictate the shift from expansion to contraction. Specifically, reduced subtropical ventilation controls the expansion of low oxygenated waters, while a combination of circulation and biological changes explains the contraction of the core (likely changes in mixing, reduced intermediate ventilation and oxygen demand). Increased model complexity (e.g., ecosystem dynamics and equatorial circulation) likely stabilize the OMZ response, suggesting that future changes might lie in the lower bound of current projections. The expansion of low oxygenated waters which delimit the optimum habitat of numerous marine species would severely impact ecosystems and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {During acclimated growth in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 a substantial proportion of the electrons extracted from water by photosystem II ultimately flow back to oxygen. This flow increases rapidly under high light, which allows Synechococcus to maintain photosystem II centers largely open, even under excessive excitation. The electron flow to oxygen with increasing light accounts for the progressive discrepancy between the light response curve of measured oxygen evolution, and the light response curve of photosystem II activity estimated from fluorescence measures. In cells under anoxia this flexible electron sink is lost and photosystem II centers suffer partial closure at the growth light intensity, with closure becoming more severe under excess light. As predicted from earlier work this PSII closure results in rapid loss of psbAI message, encoding the D1:1 protein of PSII, and induction of psbAII/AIII encoding the alternate D1:2 protein. The changes in the mRNA pool are not, however, reflected at the protein level, and D1:1 remains in the thylakoid membranes. There is no accumulation of D1:2, despite some continued synthesis of other proteins. PSII closure, therefore, results in repression of psbAI and induction psbAII/AIII expression, but D1:1/D1:2 exchange is blocked by anoxia, downstream from transcription. D1:1 protein and PSII activity are quite stable under anoxia and moderate illumination. Nevertheless, upon recovery under oxygenic conditions, the existing D1:1 is lost from the membranes, resulting in a transient drop in PSII activity. This suggests that under normal conditions the cells use oxygen to facilitate preemptive turnover of D1 proteins.},

Differences in the quantification, parameterization and terminology of Photosystem II photoinactivation and repair can erect barriers to understanding, and particular parameterizations are sometimes incorrectly associated with particular mechanistic models. These issues lead to problems for ecophysiologists seeking robust methods to include photoinhibition in ecological models. We present a comparative analysis of terms and parameterizations applied to photoinactivation and repair of Photosystem II. In particular, we show that the target size and quantum yield approaches are interconvertible generalizations of the rate constant of photoinactivation across a range of incident light levels. Our particular emphasis is on phytoplankton, although we draw upon the literature from vascular plants. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II.},

Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 {\texttimes} 105 cells ml-1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small ({$<$}2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.},

Although not as bright as the vital Hoechst stains for DNA, DAPI has greater photostability. It is believed that DAPI associates with the minor groove of double-stranded DNA, with a preference for the adenine-thymine clusters. Cells must be permeabilized and/or fixed for DAPI to enter the cell and to bind DNA. Fluorescence increases approximately 20-fold when DAPI is bound to double-stranded DNA. This protocol describes the use of DAPI to label nuclear DNA of cells grown in culture.},

To probe these effects, we comparably explored the growth, cell compositions, photosynthesis, and transcriptome of a diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana under a matrix of pO2 levels and Light:Dark cycles at an optimal growth light. The growth rate (\&mu;) of T. pseudonana under a 8:16 L:D cycle was enhanced by 34\% by low pO2 but reduced by 22\% by hypoxia. Under a 16:8 L:D cycle, however, the \&mu; decreased with decreasing pO2 level. The cellular Chl a content decreased with decreasing pO2 under a 8:16 L:D cycle, whereas the protein content decreased under a 16:8 L:D cycle. The prolonged photoperiod reduced the Chl a but enhanced the protein contents. The lowered pO2 reduced the maximal PSII photochemical quantum yield (FV/FM), photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (Pn), and respiration rate (Rd) under the 8:16 or 16:8 L:D cycles. Cellular malondialdehyde (MDA) content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were higher under low pO2 than ambient pO2 or hypoxia. Moreover, the prolonged photoperiod reduced the FV/FM and Pn among all three pO2 levels but enhanced the Rd, MDA, and SOD activity. Transcriptome data showed that most of 26 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that mainly relate to photosynthesis, respiration, and metabolism were down-regulated by hypoxia, with varying expression degrees between the 8:16 and 16:8 L:D cycles. In addition, our results demonstrated that the positive or negative effect of lowering pO2 upon the growth of diatoms depends on the pO2 level and is mediated by the photoperiod.},

These cells are smaller than the coccoid cyanobacteria and reach concentrations greater than 105 cells ml--1 in the deep euphotic zone. They fluoresce red and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment, as well as chlorophyll b, {$\alpha$}-carotene, and zeaxanthin. This unusual combination of pigments, and a distinctive prokaryotic ultrastructure, suggests that these picoplankters are free-living relatives of Prochloron7. They differ from previously reported prochlorophytes---the putative ancestors of the chloroplasts of higher plants---in that they contain {$\alpha$}-carotene rather than {$\beta$}-carotene and contain a divinyl chlorophyll a-like pigment as the dominant chlorophyll.},

Populations of this picocyanobacterium have been observed below the euphotic zone, but the viability of these cells is unclear. To explore the tolerance of Prochlorococcus to extended light-deprivation, we subjected multiple strains of Prochlorococcus to varying periods of darkness and examined their ability to recover when placed back in the light. Some strains recovered after 35 h of darkness while others could not; this variability was not related to whether the strains were members of high- or low- light adapted ecotypes. The presence of a marine heterotroph, Alteromonas macleodii MIT1002, in the cultures extended their ability to survive prolonged darkness, in the most extreme case by 11 d. This could be attributed at least in part to the reduction of hydrogen peroxide in co-cultures, consistent with known roles of ``helper bacteria'' in detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, and this effect could be mimicked to some degree by the addition of a known hydrogen peroxide quencher, sodium pyruvate. The addition of glucose alone to the cultures provided marginal enhancement, but when both pyruvate and glucose were added together, all strains were able to survive longer in darkness than they were with only the heterotroph added. Thus, it appears that Prochlorococcus dark-survival depends on a multitude of factors. Limited analyses of Synechococcus suggest that its dark-survival capacity is longer than that of Prochlorococcus, for reasons that are not yet clear.},

By using mass spectrometric measurement of oxygen exchange performed in the presence of \textsuperscript{18}O-enriched O\textsubscript{2} and Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in PS I, we show that electrons can be directed to a quinol oxidase sensitive to propyl gallate but insensitive to salicyl hydroxamic acid.

The mechanisms behind the sinking of picocyanobacteria remain a point of contention, given that they are too small to sink on their own. To gain a mechanistic understanding of the potential role of picocyanobacteria in carbon export, we tested their ability to form "suspended" (5-60 {$\mu$}m) and "visible" (ca. {$>$} 0.1 mm) aggregates, as well as their production of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP)-which are a key component in the formation of marine aggregates. Additionally, we investigated if interactions with heterotrophic bacteria play a role in TEP production and aggregation in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus by comparing xenic and axenic cultures. We observed TEP production and aggregation in batch cultures of axenic Synechococcus, but not in axenic Prochlorococcus. Heterotrophic bacteria enhanced TEP production as well as suspended and visible aggregate formation in Prochlorococcus, while in Synechococcus, aggregation was enhanced with no changes in TEP. Aggregation experiments using a natural plankton community dominated by picocyanobacteria resulted in aggregation only in the presence of the ballasting mineral kaolinite, and only when Synechococcus were in their highest seasonal abundance. Our results point to a different export potential between the two picocyanobacteria, which may be mediated by interactions with heterotrophic bacteria and presence of ballasting minerals. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanistic role of bacteria in TEP production and aggregation of these picocyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Oxygen reducing terminal oxidases differ with respect to their subunit composition, heme groups, operon structure, and affinity for O2. Six families of terminal oxidases are currently recognized, all of which occur in alphaproteobacterial genomes, two of which are also present in mitochondria. Many alphaproteobacteria encode several different terminal oxidases, likely reflecting ecological versatility with respect to oxygen levels. Terminal oxidase evolution likely started with the advent of O2 roughly 2.4 billion years ago and terminal oxidases diversified in the Proterozoic, during which oxygen levels remained low, around the Pasteur point (ca. 2 {$\mu$}M O2). Among the alphaproteobacterial genomes surveyed, those from members of the Rhodospirillaceae reveal the greatest diversity in oxygen reductases. Some harbor all six terminal oxidase types, in addition to many soluble enzymes typical of anaerobic fermentations in mitochondria and hydrogenosomes of eukaryotes. Recent data have it that O2 levels increased to current values (21\% v/v or ca. 250 {$\mu$}M) only about 430 million years ago. Ecological adaptation brought forth different lineages of alphaproteobacteria and different lineages of eukaryotes that have undergone evolutionary specialization to high oxygen, low oxygen, and anaerobic habitats. Some have remained facultative anaerobes that are able to generate ATP with or without the help of oxygen and represent physiological links to the ancient proteobacterial lineage at the origin of mitochondria and eukaryotes. Our analysis reveals that the genomes of alphaproteobacteria appear to retain signatures of ancient transitions in aerobic metabolism, findings that are relevant to mitochondrial evolution in eukaryotes as well.},

  abstract = {Pangenomes offer detailed characterizations of core and accessory genes found in a set of closely related microbial genomes, generally by clustering genes based on sequence homology. In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis and visualization strategy that provides an interactive and reproducible framework to generate pangenomes and to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the context of a large-scale marine metagenomic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genomes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, phylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing availability of environmental metagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the functioning and the ecology of microbial populations, and metapangenomes can provide unique insights for any taxon and biome for which genomic and sufficiently deep metagenomic data are available.},

We illustrate its usage with Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, a model cyanobacterium used as a chassis for sustainable cell-factories and capable of turning CO2 into commodity products. The cultivation method we developed resembles a `photonfluxostat'. It enables the setting of the growth rate of phototrophs during batch cultivation by adjustment of the illumination intensity (`photon dosing'). Using this method to study the growth-rate response of Synechocystis, we found that while the cell volume increased, the chlorophyll a content and the PSI/PSII ratio decreased, as growth rate increased. This method allows for a quantitative and controlled study of the light-dependent physiology of phototropic bacteria, a highly relevant group of bacteria for modern biotechnology.},

We conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the kaiA genes across cyanobacteria. The results show that, in contrast to the previous reports, kaiA has an ancient origin and is as old as cyanobacteria. The kaiA homologs are present in nearly all analyzed cyanobacteria, except Gloeobacter, and have varying domain architecture. Some Prochlorococcales, which were previously reported to lack the kaiA gene, possess a drastically truncated homolog. The existence of the diverse kaiA homologs suggests significant variation of the circadian mechanism, which was described for the model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942. The major structural modifications in the kaiA genes (duplications, acquisition and loss of domains) have apparently been induced by global environmental changes in the different geological periods.},

  abstract = {Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton leads to formation of {$\sim$}45 gigatons of organic carbon per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric CO2 levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Isotopic fractionations produced by biosynthetic processes are the result of networks of individual biochemical reactions that operate at differing efficiencies and with distinct fractionation factors. These reaction networks determine the magnitude and direction of the net isotopic fractionation associated with a given process. Here we examine the ways that biological reaction networks control mass-dependent isotopic fractionations of multiple sulphur isotopes. We describe how material-flow through some networks can produce characteristic multiple-sulphur-isotope signatures that differ from those produced by their constituent steps and demonstrate that experimental results with Archaeaglobus fulgidus can be evaluated using multiple sulphur isotopes in the context of previously published models for dissimilatory sulphate reduction. Our evaluation of these data is consistent with the interpretation that the dependence of sulphur isotope fractionation on external sulphate concentration is rooted in differences between the forward and reverse {$\leftrightarrow$} adenosine-5{$\prime$}-phosphosulphate (APS) {$\leftrightarrow$} steps. The framework provided by our analysis has the potential to evaluate the biosynthetic pathways that produce the isotopic fractionations, to isolate the primary sources of isotopic fractionations (sulphate reduction or disproportionation reactions) and to establish criteria to identify the signature of specific sulphur metabolisms in the geological record. The results highlight the new types of information that can be obtained by including measurements of {$\delta$}33S {$\delta$}33S = [(33S/32S)sample/(33S/32S)reference - 1]*1000 with measurements of {$\delta$}34S.},

  abstract = {Across the globe, heat waves are getting more intense and frequent. Diatoms are a major group of microalgae at the base of the marine food webs and an important source of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are transferred through the food web. The present study investigates the possible impacts of temperature increase on lipid classes and expression of genes encoding enzymes related to lipid metabolism in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The heat wave exposure caused an increase in the relative amounts of plastidial lipids such as the glycolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) and sulphoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) in parallel with a decrease in the neutral lipid fraction, which includes triacylglycerols. In agreement, gene expression analyses revealed an up-regulation of a gene encoding one MGDG synthase and down-regulation of a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), a key enzyme in triacylglycerol synthesis. Our results show that heat waves not only negatively impact the abundance of unsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n3, EPA) and hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3n-4) as observed by the decrease in their relative abundance in MGDG and neutral lipids, respectively, but also induce changes in the relative amounts of the diverse membrane lipids as well as the proportion of membrane/storage lipids. The expression study of key genes indicates that some of the aforementioned alterations are regulated at the transcription level whereas others appear to be posttranscriptional. The changes observed in plastidial lipids are related to negative impacts on the photosynthesis.},

With increasing nitrogen limitation, cellular divinyl chlorophyll a and the functional absorption cross section of Photosystem II decreased, although maximal photosynthetic efficiency of PSII remained unaltered across all N-limited growth rates. Chl-specific gross and net carbon primary production were also invariant with nutrient-limited growth rate, but only 20\% of Chl-specific gross carbon primary production was retained in the biomass across all growth rates. In nitrogen-replete cells, 60\% of the assimilated carbon was incorporated into the protein pool while only 30\% was incorporated into carbohydrates. As N limitation increased, new carbon became evenly distributed between these two pools. While many of these physiological traits are similar to those measured in other algae, there are also distinct differences, particularly the lower overall efficiency of carbon utilization. The latter provides new information needed for understanding and estimating primary production, particularly in the nutrient-limited tropical oceans where P. marinus dominates phytoplankton community composition.},

Approaches based on satellite indices of absorbed solar radiation indicate marked heterogeneity in NPP for both land and oceans, reflecting the influence of physical and ecological processes. The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints. On land and ocean, progressive changes in NPP can result in altered carbon storage, although contrasts in mechanisms of carbon storage and rates of organic matter turnover result in a range of relations between carbon storage and changes in NPP.},

Health effects, positive as well as negative, are believed to result mainly from minor components in the food. In macro- and microalgae as well as in certain cyanobacteria, one class of such minor compounds is sulfolipids, more precisely sulfoquinovosylmonoacylglycerol (SQMG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) derivatives. SQMGs and SQDGs consist of a diacylglycerol esterified with varying fatty acid combinations and a sulfoquinovose moiety. Sulfoquinovose is a sulfonated hexose analogous to d-glucose, but featuring a stable carbon-sulfur bond. With regard to their chemical structure, SQDGs can be distinguished according to their sn1- and sn2-bound fatty acids. Although there is great interest in SQDGs, because of their controversially discussed bioactivities, only a negligible number of comprehensive methods for identification and quantification has been published, so far. Within this work, a sample preparation including a quantitative isolation of SQDGs from selected raw materials, a clean-up with solid-phase extraction (SPE), and a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous identification and quantitation of different, intact SQMGs and SQDGs were developed and validated. The applicability of the method was further demonstrated by comparing a prominent cyanobacterium (Arthrospira sp.) with a microalgae preparation (Chlorella vulgaris), and selected leafy vegetables (spinach, basil).},

Here, we present quantitative niche models for these lineages that assess present and future global abundances and distributions. These niche models are the result of neural network, nonparametric, and parametric analyses, and they rely on {$>$}35,000 discrete observations from all major ocean regions. The models assess cell abundance based on temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but the individual responses to these environmental variables differ for each lineage. The models estimate global biogeographic patterns and seasonal variability of cell abundance, with maxima in the warm oligotrophic gyres of the Indian and the western Pacific Oceans and minima at higher latitudes. The annual mean global abundances of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are 2.9 {\textpm} 0.1 {\texttimes} 1027 and 7.0 {\textpm} 0.3 {\texttimes} 1026 cells, respectively. Using projections of sea surface temperature as a result of increased concentration of greenhouse gases at the end of the 21st century, our niche models projected increases in cell numbers of 29\% and 14\% for Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, respectively. The changes are geographically uneven but include an increase in area. Thus, our global niche models suggest that oceanic microbial communities will experience complex changes as a result of projected future climate conditions. Because of the high abundances and contributions to primary production of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, these changes may have large impacts on ocean ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles.},

Here we present a benchtop stirred continuous culture bioreactor capable of withstanding temperatures ranging from 25 to 120{$^\circ$}C and pressures as high as 69 MPa. The system is configured to allow the employment of media enriched in dissolved gases, under oxic or anoxic conditions, while permitting periodic sampling of the incubated organisms with minimal physical/chemical disturbance inside the reactor. In a pilot experiment, the fermentative growth of the thermopiezophilic bacterium Marinitoga piezophila was investigated continuously for 382 h at 65{$^\circ$}C and at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 40 MPa while the medium flow rate was varied from 2 to 0.025 ml/min. The enhanced growth observed at 30 and 40 MPa and 0.025 ml/min supports the pressure preferences of M. piezophila when grown fermentatively. This assay successfully demonstrates the capabilities of the bioreactor for continuous culturing at a variety of dilution rates, pressures, and temperatures. We anticipate that this technology will accelerate our understanding of the physiological and metabolic status of microorganisms under temperature, pressure, and energy regimes resembling those of the Earth's piezosphere.},

Cyanophages at the oxic primary chlorophyll maximum encoded genes related to light and phosphate stress (psbA, psbD and pstS in T4-like and psbA in T7-like), but the proportion of cyanophage with these genes decreased with depth. The proportion of cyanophage with purine biosynthesis genes increased with depth in T4-like, but not T7-like cyanophages. No additional host-derived genes were found in deep T7-like cyanophages, suggesting that T4-like and T7-like cyanophages have different host-derived gene acquisition strategies, possibly linked to their different genome packaging mechanisms. In contrast to the ETNP, in the oxic North Atlantic T4-like cyanophages encoded psbA and pstS throughout the euphotic zone. Differences in pstS between the ETNP and the North Atlantic stations were consistent with differences in phosphate concentrations in those regimes. We suggest that the low proportion of cyanophage with psbA within the ODZ reflects the stably stratified low-light conditions occupied by their hosts, a Prochlorococcus ecotype endemic to ODZs.},

In contrast, Prochlorococcus elemental composition remained unaffected by CO2, but cell volume and elemental quotas doubled with increasing temperature while maintaining constant stoichiometry.

  abstract = {Chlorophyll a (Chl) is a light-absorbing tetrapyrrole pigment that is essential for photosynthesis. The molecule is produced from glutamate via a complex biosynthetic pathway comprised of at least 15 enzymatic steps. The first half of the Chl pathway is shared with heme biosynthesis, and the latter half, called the Mg-branch, is specific to Mg-containing Chl a. Bilin pigments, such as phycocyanobilin, are additionally produced from heme, so these light-harvesting pigments also share many common biosynthetic steps with Chl biosynthesis. Some of these common steps in the biosynthetic pathways of heme, Chl and bilins require molecular oxygen for catalysis, such as oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase. Cyanobacteria thrive in diverse environments in terms of oxygen levels. To cope with Chl deficiency caused by low-oxygen conditions, cyanobacteria have developed elaborate mechanisms to maintain Chl production, even under microoxic environments. The use of enzymes specialized for low-oxygen conditions, such as oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, constitutes part of a mechanism adapted to low-oxygen conditions. Another mechanism adaptive to hypoxic conditions is mediated by the transcriptional regulator ChlR that senses low oxygen and subsequently activates the transcription of genes encoding enzymes that work under low-oxygen tension. In diazotrophic cyanobacteria, this multilayered regulation also contributes in Chl biosynthesis by supporting energy production for nitrogen fixation that also requires low-oxygen conditions. We will also discuss the evolutionary implications of cyanobacterial tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and regulation, because low oxygen-type enzymes also appear to be evolutionarily older than oxygen-dependent enzymes.},

Fluridone, a carotenoid biosynthesis inhibiting herbicide, was utilized to generate algal cells with different levels of colored carotenoids so that the protection provided by colored carotenoid pigments in algal cells to the photo-induced toxicity of anthracene could be measured. The percent inhibition of [14C]bicarbonate incorporation due to the photo-induced toxicity of anthracene was inversely correlated to the concentration of colored carotenoid pigments in S. capricornutum cells. The greater sensitivity of algal cells exposed to anthracene and ultraviolet-A radiation caused by lesser concentrations of colored carotenoid pigments in the algal cells is in agreement with a type II (singlet oxygen) mechanism, in vivo, for photo-induced toxicity of anthracene. The ability of naturally-occurring carotenoids pigments to protect algal cells from photooxidants may explain the greater resistance of algae to the photo-induced toxicity of anthracene relative to aquatic animals. The importance of the protection provided by carotenoid pigments within algal cells against other toxicants, such as solar ultraviolet radiation, could be assessed utilizing this proposed bioassay system.},

  abstract = {Anoxic marine zones (AMZs) create expansive habitats for microbes whose anaerobic metabolisms help drive global nutrient cycles, for example, by removing nitrogen from the oceans by producing N2 gas. AMZ cycles may also be shaped by oxygen intrusion from outside the AMZ, creating opportunities for aerobic microbial metabolisms. Here we show that aerobic processes in AMZs are linked to oxygen production within the anoxic zone. Oxygen is produced during daytime in a layer of photosynthetic cyanobacteria near the top of the AMZ and then rapidly consumed by aerobic processes without accumulating. Oxygen turnover and carbon fixation rates are comparable to those of microbial N2 production, suggesting an important role for internal oxygen cycling in AMZ transformations of matter and energy., Oxygen availability drives changes in microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling between the aerobic surface layer and the anaerobic core in nitrite-rich anoxic marine zones (AMZs), which constitute huge oxygen-depleted regions in the tropical oceans. The current paradigm is that primary production and nitrification within the oxic surface layer fuel anaerobic processes in the anoxic core of AMZs, where 30--50\% of global marine nitrogen loss takes place. Here we demonstrate that oxygenic photosynthesis in the secondary chlorophyll maximum (SCM) releases significant amounts of O2 to the otherwise anoxic environment. The SCM, commonly found within AMZs, was dominated by the picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus spp. Free O2 levels in this layer were, however, undetectable by conventional techniques, reflecting a tight coupling between O2 production and consumption by aerobic processes under apparent anoxic conditions. Transcriptomic analysis of the microbial community in the seemingly anoxic SCM revealed the enhanced expression of genes for aerobic processes, such as nitrite oxidation. The rates of gross O2 production and carbon fixation in the SCM were found to be similar to those reported for nitrite oxidation, as well as for anaerobic dissimilatory nitrate reduction and sulfate reduction, suggesting a significant effect of local oxygenic photosynthesis on Pacific AMZ biogeochemical cycling.},

\item Local photosynthesis has significant effect on the biogeochemical cycling in pacific ocean anoxic marine zones

\item Using secondary chlorophyll maximum water with trace O2 conditions revealed [O2] with time differed substantially between dark and light incubated samples
\item Net community production (corresponding to the slope of O2 production - and so also the balance between O2 production and consumption) gradually increased to more positive values with increasing irradiance~
\item Most of the measured O2 consumption could be due to nitrite oxidation

The globally averaged ocean surface temperature shows a mean warming trend of 0.062 {\textpm} 0.013{$^\circ$}C per decade over the last 120 years (1900--2019). During the last decade (2010--2019) the rate of ocean surface warming has accelerated to 0.280 {\textpm} 0.068{$^\circ$}C per decade, 4.5 times higher than the long term mean. Ocean Heat Content in the upper 2,000 m shows a linear warming rate of 0.35 {\textpm} 0.08 Wm--2 in the period 1955--2019 (65 years). The warming rate during the last decade (2010--2019) is twice (0.70 {\textpm} 0.07 Wm--2) the warming rate of the long term record. Each of the last six decades have been warmer than the previous one. Global surface ocean pH has declined on average by approximately 0.1 pH units (from 8.2 to 8.1) since the industrial revolution (1770). By the end of this century (2100) ocean pH is projected to decline additionally by 0.1--0.4 pH units depending on the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) and SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) future scenario. The time of emergence of the pH climate change signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites, and 16--41 years for coastal sites. Global dissolved oxygen levels have decreased by 4.8 petamoles or 2\% in the last 5 decades, with profound impacts on local and basin scale habitats. Regional trends are varying due to multiple processes impacting dissolved oxygen: solubility change, respiration changes, ocean circulation changes and multidecadal variability. Arctic sea ice extent has been declining by -13.1\% per decade in summer (September) and by -2.6\% per decade in winter (March) during the last 4 decades (1979--2020). The combined trends of sea ice extent and sea ice thickness indicate that the volume of non-seasonal Arctic Sea Ice has decreased by 75\% since 1979. Global mean sea level has increased in the period 1993--2019 (the altimetry era) at a mean rate of 3.15 {\textpm} 0.3 mm year--1 and is experiencing an acceleration of {$\sim$} 0.084 (0.06--0.10) mm year--2. During the last century (1900--2015; 115y) global mean sea level (GMSL) has rised 19 cm, and near 40\% of that GMSL rise has taken place since 1993 (22y). Independent proxies of the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) indicate that AMOC is at its weakest for several hundreds of years and has been slowing down during the last century. A final visual summary of key ocean climate change indicators during the recent decades is provided.},

The average range of isotopic biosignatures generally follows that produced by extant cyanobacteria. However, this observation is difficult to reconcile with several environmental (e.g., temperature, pH, and CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations), molecular and physiological factors that likely would have differed during the Precambrian and can produce fractionation variability in contemporary organisms that meets or exceeds that observed in the geologic record. To test a range of genetic and environmental factors that may have impacted ancient carbon isotope biosignatures, we engineered a mutant strain of the model cyanobacterium \emph{Synechococcus elongatus} PCC 7942 that overexpresses RuBisCO and characterized the resultant physiological and isotope fractionation effects. We specifically investigated how both increased atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations and RuBisCO regulation influence cell growth, oxygen evolution rate, and carbon isotope fractionation in cyanobacteria. We found that \&gt;2\% CO\textsubscript{2} increases the growth rate of wild-type and mutant strains, and that the pool of active RuBisCO enzyme increases with increased expression. At elevated CO\textsubscript{2}, carbon isotope discrimination ({$\varepsilon$}\textsubscript{p}) is increased by {\textasciitilde}8‰, whereas RuBisCO overexpression does not significantly affect isotopic discrimination at all tested CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations.

RuBisCO enzymes, distinctive and early-evolved catalysts that fix atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2}, have likely been responsible for the bulk of primary productivity through Earth history. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular, physiological, environmental, and evolutionary factors that influence the isotopic discrimination of cyanobacteria that utilize RuBisCO is essential for the interpretation of ancient isotopic biosignatures. For example, the vastly different atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} levels that characterized the Precambrian may have influenced the expression and regulation of the ancient RuBisCO protein complex. These observations underscore the need to consider how a broader range of environmental conditions and subcellular processes may have shaped isotopic discrimination over geologic time. In this study, we establish a cyanobacterial metabolic-engineering strategy that can test such hypotheses and offer insights into the biogeochemical record of life.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Multidisciplinary ocean observing activities provide critical ocean information to satisfy ever-changing socioeconomic needs and require coordinated implementation. The upper oxycline (transition between high and low oxygen waters) is fundamentally important for the ecosystem structure and can be a useful proxy for multiple observing objectives connected to eastern boundary systems (EBSs) that neighbor oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). The variability of the oxycline and its impact on the ecosystem (VOICE) initiative demonstrates how societal benefits drive the need for integration and optimization of biological, biogeochemical, and physical components of regional ocean observing related to EBS. In liaison with the Global Ocean Oxygen Network, VOICE creates a roadmap toward observation-model syntheses for a comprehensive understanding of selected oxycline-dependent objectives. Local to global effects, such as habitat compression or deoxygenation trends, prompt for comprehensive observing of the oxycline on various space and time scales, and for an increased awareness of its impact on ecosystem services. Building on the Framework for Ocean Observing (FOO), we present a first readiness level assessment for ocean observing of the oxycline in EBS. This was to determine current ocean observing design and future needs in EBS regions (e.g., the California Current System, the Equatorial Eastern Pacific off Ecuador, the Peru--Chile Current system, the Northern Benguela off Namibia, etc.) building on the FOO strategy. We choose regional champions to assess the ocean observing design elements proposed in the FOO, namely, requirement processes, coordination of observational elements, and data management and information products and the related best practices. The readiness level for the FOO elements was derived for each EBS through a similar and very general ad hoc questionnaire. Despite some weaknesses in the questionnaire design and its completion, an assessment was achievable. We found that fisheries and ecosystem management are a societal requirement for all regions, but maturity levels of observational elements and data management and information products differ substantially. Identification of relevant stakeholders, developing strategies for readiness level improvements, and building and sustaining infrastructure capacity to implement these strategies are fundamental milestones for the VOICE initiative over the next 2--5 years and beyond.},

The PS I-enriched fractions of both strains contained about 100 chlorophyll molecules per P700. Electron microscopy showed that the PS I complexes were in a trimeric form. The characteristic long wavelength fluorescence emission of PS I at 77 K, currently observed in chloroplasts and most cyanobacteria was absent both in intact cells and in PS I preparations of both strains. The major proteins of the PS I-enriched fractions were identified immunologically as PsaA and PsaB. Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of about 21 and 25 kDa were present in PS I preparations of Prochlorococcus, whereas the small PS I subunits in cyanobacteria all have molecular masses below 18 kDa. The 25 kDa protein showed a strong cross-reaction with a heterologous antibody against PsaL. Relatedness of the 21 kDa protein to PsaF was demonstrated by internal protein sequencing. Although only trace amounts of the major divinyl-Chl a/b-binding antenna complexes were present in the PS I preparations, significant amounts of divinyl-Chl b were observed in this fraction. The putative organization of this Chl b in PS I is discussed.},

These ecotypes are characterized by their different (divinyl-) chlorophyll (Chl) a to Chl b ratios and 16S rRNA gene signatures, as well as by their significantly distinct irradiance optima for growth and photosynthesis [Moore, L. R., Rocap, G. \& Chisholm, S. W. (1998) Nature (London) 393, 464--467]. However, the molecular basis of their physiological differences remained, so far, unexplained. In this paper, we show that the low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus strain SS120 possesses a gene family of seven transcribed genes encoding different Chl a/b-binding proteins (Pcbs). In contrast, Prochlorococcus sp. MED4, a high-light-adapted ecotype, possesses a single pcb gene. The presence of multiple antenna genes in another low-light ecotype (NATL2a), but not in another high-light ecotype (TAK9803--2), is demonstrated. Thus, the multiplication of pcb genes appears as a key factor in the capacity of deep Prochlorococcus populations to survive at extremely low photon fluxes.},

However, oceanographic applications must face two constraints. First, when dealing with marine microbes, instruments must be sensitive because these organisms are very small and with low fluorescence. Second, instruments must be portable to be used on board ships. We compared the performance of two instruments, the BD FACSCanto™ and BD Accuri™ C6. The former is an expensive laboratory-based instrument which has a very good sensitivity, whilst the latter is less sensitive but presents critical advantages for field studies (easy handling and transportation, relatively low cost). We have analyzed 102 samples from the South Atlantic Ocean from three transects off Brazil, within the euphotic zone. We compared cell abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as well as photosynthetic pico- and nano-eukaryotes. Heterotrophic bacteria, pico- and nano-eukaryotes could be easily detected with both cytometers. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations were severely under-estimated with the BD Accuri™ C6, particularly for samples from the well-lit layers of the water column. Correction of abundance data using previously suggested approaches was not sufficient to fully compensate for the low sensibility. Our data suggest that the BD Accuri™ C6 is suitable for counting marine bacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes, but not Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.},

Within temperate ecosystems, these conditions not only develop seasonally as temperatures rise and metabolic rates accelerate, but can also display strong diurnal variability, especially in shallow systems where photosynthetic rates ameliorate hypoxia and acidification by day. Despite the widespread, global co-occurrence of low pH and low DO and the likelihood that these conditions may negatively impact marine life, very few studies have actually assessed the extent to which the combination of both stressors elicits additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects in marine organisms. We review the evidence from published factorial experiments that used static and/or fluctuating pH and DO levels to examine different traits (e.g. survival, growth, metabolism), life stages and species across a broad taxonomic spectrum. Additive negative effects of combined low pH and low DO appear to be most common; however, synergistic negative effects have also been observed. Neither the occurrence nor the strength of these synergistic impacts is currently predictable, and therefore, the true threat of concurrent acidification and hypoxia to marine food webs and fisheries is still not fully understood. Addressing this knowledge gap will require an expansion of multi-stressor approaches in experimental and field studies, and the development of a predictive framework. In consideration of marine policy, we note that DO criteria in coastal waters have been developed without consideration of concurrent pH levels. Given the persistence of concurrent low pH--low DO conditions in estuaries and the increased mortality experienced by fish and bivalves under concurrent acidification and hypoxia compared with hypoxia alone, we conclude that such DO criteria may leave coastal fisheries more vulnerable to population reductions than previously anticipated.},

SQ is produced by most photosynthetic organisms and incorporated into the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), as well as within some archaea for incorporation into glycoprotein N-glycans. SQDG is found mainly within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast, where it appears to be important for membrane structure and function and for optimal activity of photosynthetic protein complexes. SQDG metabolism within the sulfur cycle involves complex biosynthetic and catabolic processes. SQDG biosynthesis is largely conserved within plants, algae and bacteria. On the other hand, two major sulfoglycolytic pathways have been discovered for SQDG degradation, the sulfo-Embden--Meyerhof--Parnas (sulfo-EMP) and sulfo-Entner--Doudoroff (sulfo-ED) pathways, which mirror the major steps in the glycolytic EMP and ED pathways. Sulfoglycolysis produces C3-sulfonates, which undergo biomineralization to inorganic sulfur species, completing the sulfur cycle. This review discusses the discovery and structural elucidation of SQDG and archaeal N-glycans, the occurrence, distribution, and speciation of SQDG, and metabolic pathways leading to the biosynthesis of SQDG and its catabolism through sulfoglycolytic and biomineralization pathways to inorganic sulfur.},

Using its unique pigment divinyl-chlorophyll a (Chl a2) as a chemosystematic marker, we show that Prochlorococcus is present at a station in the Sargasso Sea throughout most of the year. Whereas it is only found at depth during the early summer, it can be found throughout the euphotic zone during the rest of the year. Averaged over the year Prochlorococcus pigment-biomass constitutes about 30\% of the total. Its growth rate, estimated from the incorporation of 14C into Chl a2 ranged from values of 0.3 day-1 in the surface layer to values less than 0.1 day-1 at the bottom of the euphotic zone. Averaged over the seasons, approximately 25\% of the total productivity was due to Prochlorococcus. Prochlorococcus clearly is an important component of the ecosystem in the Sargasso Sea, and perhaps the world ocean.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus marinus is present in all tropical and subtropical oceans, where it is often found throughout the euphotic zone, contributing significantly to phytoplankton biomass and primary production and growing at rates comparable to those of other picoplankters. Clearly, Prochlorococcus and eucaryotic picoplankton share significant niche dimensions in the open ocean. Here we report the discovery of populations of Prochlorococcus in layers below the oxyclines of the oxygen minimum zones of the Arabian Sea and the Eastern Tropical North Pacific off Mexico. The unusual aspects of these populations are that these were at times virtual monoalgal cultures found at a depth of 80 to 140m, often below the euphotic zone, where irradiance ranged from less than 0.1 to 2\% of the surface irradiance (I0). The pigment complement of these deep populations was characterized in detail. The previously unidentified Chl-c-like pigment of Prochlorococcus is Mg-3,8-divinylpheoporphyrin a5 monomethylester. The carotenoid complement of populations in these deep layers was similar to that of cultured Prochlorococcus strains, except for high concentrations of a 7{$\prime$},8{$\prime$}-dihydro-derivative of zeaxanthin, quite likely parasiloxanthin. Even though cellular concentrations of pigments were very high in these populations, suggesting acclimation to low irradiance, ambient light experienced by these populations in the Arabian Sea, {$<$}0.1\% I0, may not have been sufficient to support normal photoautotrophic growth. Off Mexico these deep Prochlorococcus populations were located at 0.2 and 2\% I0 isolumes, an irradiance likely sufficient for slow growth. Environmental conditions in these layers, except for concentrations of oxygen, are similar to those found at and below the subsurface chlorophyll maxima of the subtropical central gyres. As only Prochlorococcus thrives in these layers but Prochlorococcus and eucaryotic picoplankton coexist in and below subsurface chlorophyll maxima, we conclude that the low oxygen concentrations at the deep Prochlorococcus maxima are the determining factor, but we are not able to identify any specific physiological functions that are affected by low oxygen concentrations in eucaryotes but not Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {The marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus have been considered photoautotrophic microorganisms, although the utilization of exogenous sugars has never been specifically addressed in them. We studied glucose uptake in different high irradiance- and low irradiance-adapted Prochlorococcus strains, as well as the effect of glucose addition on the expression of several glucose-related genes. Glucose uptake was measured by adding radiolabelled glucose to Prochlorococcus cultures, followed by flow cytometry coupled with cell sorting in order to separate Prochlorococcus cells from bacterial contaminants. Sorted cells were recovered by filtration and their radioactivity measured. The expression, after glucose addition, of several genes (involved in glucose metabolism, and in nitrogen assimilation and its regulation) was determined in the low irradiance-adapted Prochlorococcus SS120 strain by semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR, using the rnpB gene as internal control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the Prochlorococcus strains studied in this work take up glucose at significant rates even at concentrations close to those found in the oceans, and also exclude the possibility of this uptake being carried out by eventual bacterial contaminants, since only Prochlorococcus cells were used for radioactivity measurements. Besides, we show that the expression of a number of genes involved in glucose utilization (namely zwf, gnd and dld, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively) is strongly increased upon glucose addition to cultures of the SS120 strain. This fact, taken together with the magnitude of the glucose uptake, clearly indicates the physiological importance of the phenomenon. Given the significant contribution of Prochlorococcus to the global primary production, these findings have strong implications for the understanding of the phytoplankton role in the carbon cycle in nature. Besides, the ability of assimilating carbon molecules could provide additional hints to comprehend the ecological success of Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are major contributors to global oceanic primary production and exhibit a unique diversity of photosynthetic pigments, allowing them to exploit a wide range of light niches. However, the relationship between pigment content and niche partitioning has remained largely undetermined due to the lack of a single-genetic marker resolving all pigment types (PTs). Here, we developed and employed a robust method based on three distinct marker genes (cpcBA, mpeBA, and mpeW) to estimate the relative abundance of all known Synechococcus PTs from metagenomes. Analysis of the Tara Oceans dataset allowed us to reveal the global distribution of Synechococcus PTs and to define their environmental niches. Green-light specialists (PT 3a) dominated in warm, green equatorial waters, whereas blue-light specialists (PT 3c) were particularly abundant in oligotrophic areas. Type IV chromatic acclimaters (CA4-A/B), which are able to dynamically modify their light absorption properties to maximally absorb green or blue light, were unexpectedly the most abundant PT in our dataset and predominated at depth and high latitudes. We also identified populations in which CA4 might be nonfunctional due to the lack of specific CA4 genes, notably in warm high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas. Major ecotypes within clades I-IV and CRD1 were preferentially associated with a particular PT, while others exhibited a wide range of PTs. Altogether, this study provides important insights into the ecology of Synechococcus and highlights the complex interactions between vertical phylogeny, pigmentation, and environmental parameters that shape Synechococcus community structure and evolution.}

  abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques to study the effect of stresses on the photosynthetic process. From the first utilization, the Fv/Fm ratio has been largely used as a sensitive indicator of plant photosynthetic performance. Decreases of this index are indicative of the reduction of photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, namely photoinhibition. In the last 20 years, application of chlorophyll fluorescence has been largely improved, and many other informative parameters have been established to detect PSII photochemical efficiency and the partitioning of light energy to alternative dissipative mechanisms (qE, energy-dependent quenching; qZ, zeaxanthin-dependent quenching and qI, photoinhibitory quenching; qH, sustained photoprotective antenna quenching; qM, quenching dependent to chloroplast movement; qT, light harvesting complexes II--I state-transition) such as the recently developed ``photoprotective power'' of non-photochemical quenching (pNPQ). This review reports a brief description of the main chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and a wide analysis of the current bibliography on the use of different parameters which are useful to detect events of PSII photoinhibition. In addition, in view of the inherent differences in morpho-anatomical, physiological and biochemical features between C3 and C4 metabolism, possible differences in terms of photoinhibition between C3 and C4 plant species under stress conditions are proposed. The attempt is to highlight the limits of their comparison in terms of susceptibility to photoinhibition and to propose direction of future research which, assisted by chlorophyll fluorescence, should improve the knowledge of the different sensitivity of C3 and C4 to abiotic stressors.},

Evolved oxygen from isolated spinach thylakoids was isotopically identical (within analytical error) to its source water. Similar results were obtained with Anacystis nidulans Richter and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin cultures purged with helium. For consumptive reactions, discrimination ([delta], where 1 + [delta]/1000 equals the isotope effect, k16/k18 or k12/k13) was determined by analysis of residual substrate (O2 or CO2). The [delta] for the Mehler reaction, mediated by ferredoxin or methylviologen, was 15.3[per mille (thousand) sign]. Oxygen isotope discrimination during oxygenation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) catalyzed by RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was 21.3[per mille (thousand) sign] and independent of enzyme source, unlike carbon isotope discrimination: 30.3[per mille (thousand) sign] for spinach enzyme and 19.6 to 23[per mille (thousand) sign] for Rhodospirillum rubrum and A. nidulans enzymes, depending on reaction conditions. The [delta] for O2 consumption catalyzed by glycolate oxidase was 22.7[per mille (thousand) sign]. The expected overall [delta] for photorespiration is about 21.7[per mille (thousand) sign]. Consistent with this, when Asparagus sprengeri Regel mesophyll cells approached the compensation point within a sealed vessel, the [delta]18O of dissolved O2 came to a steady-state value of about 21.5[per mille (thousand) sign] relative to the source water. The results provide improved estimates of discrimination factors in several reactions prominent in the global O cycle and indicate that photorespiration plays a significant part in determining the isotopic composition of atmospheric oxygen.},

We modulated electron transfer rate and light intensity independently of each other in lincomycin-treated pea leaves and in isolated thylakoids, in order to elucidate the specific effects of light and PSII electron transport on photoinhibition. Major changes in the rate of electron transport caused only small changes in the rate of photoinhibition, suggesting the existence of a significant photoinhibitory pathway that contains an electron-transfer-independent phase. We compared the action spectrum of photoinhibition with absorption spectra of PSII components that could function as photoreceptors of the electron-transfer-independent phase of photoinhibition and found that the absorption spectra of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) compounds resemble the action spectrum of photoinhibition, showing a steep decrease from UV-C to blue light and a low visible-light tail. Our results show that the release of a Mn ion to the thylakoid lumen is the earliest detectable step of both UV- and visible-light-induced photoinhibition. After Mn release from the oxygen-evolving complex, oxidative damage to the PSII reaction center occurs because the Mn-depleted oxygen-evolving complex cannot reduce P680+ normally.},

Here, we describe the isolation of 46 closely related picocyanobacterial strains from the Baltic Sea. The isolates showed considerable variation in their cell size and pigmentation phenotypes, yielding a colorful variety of red, pink and blue-green strains. These pigmentation phenotypes could not be differentiated on the basis of their 16S rRNA-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thirty-nine strains, designated BSea, possessed 16S rRNA-ITS sequences almost identical with Synechococcus strain WH5701. Despite their similar 16S rRNA-ITS sequences, the BSea strains separated into several different clusters when comparing the phycocyanin (cpcBA) operon. This separation was largely consistent with the phycobiliprotein composition of the different BSea strains. The majority of phycocyanin (PC)-rich Bsea strains clustered with WH5701. Remarkably, the phycoerythrin (PE)-rich strains of BSea formed an as yet unidentified cluster within the cpcBA phylogeny, distantly related to other PE-rich groups. Detailed analysis of the cpcBA operon using neighbour-net analysis indicated that the PE-rich BSea strains are probably endemic for the Baltic Sea. Comparison of the phylogenies obtained by the 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpcBA, and the concatenated 16S rRNA-ITS and cpcBA operon sequences revealed possible events of horizontal gene transfer among different Synechococcus lineages. Our results show that microdiversity is important in Synechococcus populations and that it can reflect extensive diversification of different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.},

Maximizing light capture in these dim waters is expected to require upregulation of Fe-bearing photosystems, further depleting dFe and possibly leading to co-limitation by both iron and light. However, this effect has not been quantified for important phytoplankton groups like Prochlorococcus, which contributes most of the productivity in the oligotrophic DCM. Here, we present culture experiments with Prochlorococcus strain MIT1214, a member of the Low Light 1 ecotype isolated from the DCM in the North Pacific subtropical gyre. Under a matrix of iron and irradiance matching those found at the DCM, the ratio of Fe to carbon in Prochlorococcus MIT1214 cells ranged from 10--40\,{\texttimes}\,10-6\,mol Fe:mol C and increased with light intensity and growth rate. These results challenge theoretical models predicting highest Fe:C at lowest light intensity, and are best explained by a large photosynthetic Fe demand that is not downregulated at higher light. To sustain primary production in the DCM with the rigid Fe requirements of low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus, dFe must be recycled rapidly and at high efficiency.},

  abstract = {Interference with histidine metabolism, inhibition of pigment biosynthesis, or both have been the principal candidates for the primary site of action of 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (amitrole). Arabidopsis thaliana is sensitive to 1,2,4-triazole-3-alanine, a feedback inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis, and this effect is reversed by histidine. The combination of triazolealanine and histidine, however, does not reverse the herbicidal effect of amitrole. This indicates that amitrole toxicity is not caused by histidine starvation, nor is it caused by the accumulation of a toxic intermediate of the histidine pathway. Amitrole inhibits root elongation at lower concentrations than it causes pigment bleaching in the leaves. In contrast, fluridone, a known inhibitor of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway does not block root elongation. Fluridone also inhibits carotenoid accumulation in etiolated seedlings in the dark, but amitrole does not. Last, gabaculine and acifluorfen, but not amitrole, prevent chlorophyll accumulation in greening etiolated seedlings of Arabidopsis. These experiments cast doubt on pigment biosynthesis as the primary site of action of amitrole.},

Biogenesis of PSII requires coordinated assembly of at least 20 protein subunits, as well as incorporation of various organic and inorganic cofactors. The stepwise assembly process is facilitated by numerous protein factors that have been identified in recent years. Further analysis of this process requires the development or refinement of specific methods for the identification of novel assembly factors and, in particular, elucidation of the unique role of each.

This globally averaged oxygen decrease is -0.93 {\textpm} 0.23{$\mu$}mol l-1, which is equivalent to annual oxygen losses of -0.55 {\textpm} 0.13 {\texttimes} 1014 mol yr-1(100--1000 m). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15\% of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters. These observations support climate model simulations of oxygen change under global warming scenarios.},

Both oxygen and carbon-based gross primary production and respiration rates indicated a 3{\texttimes} increase between subtropical and subpolar stations. We consistently found that gross production and community respiration rates were in approximate balance at all stations across the full ecological gradient, implying that community respiration is fueled by recently produced organic matter and that recycling efficiency ( 90\%) is similar along the gradient. We determined that phytoplankton turnover time doubles (from 2 to 4 days) between subtropical and subpolar regimes, whereas biomass increases by approximately tenfold. We found a consistent photosynthetic quotient (1.4 {\textpm} 0.2 mol O2 mol C-1), respiratory quotient (1.0 {\textpm} 0.2 mol O2 mol C-1), and gross to net production ratio (2.0 {\textpm} 0.3) at all stations which underscores the similarity of fundamental ecological characteristics despite the transition f rom nutrient deplete to replete conditions. That the float- and ship-based estimates of in situ production and respiration generally agreed well suggests that float-based diel O2 and particulate organic carbon measurements have the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of spatial and temporal variability of productivity and respiration in the ocean.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a globally important marine cyanobacterium that lacks the gene catalase and relies on `helper' bacteria such as Alteromonas to remove reactive oxygen species. Increasing atmospheric CO2 decreases the need for carbon concentrating mechanisms and photorespiration in phytoplankton, potentially altering their metabolism and microbial interactions even when carbon is not limiting growth. Here, Prochlorococcus (VOL4, MIT9312) was co-cultured with Alteromonas (strain EZ55) under ambient (400\,p.p.m.) and elevated CO2 (800\,p.p.m.). Under elevated CO2, Prochlorococcus had a significantly longer lag phase and greater apparent die-offs after transfers suggesting an increase in oxidative stress. Whole-transcriptome analysis of Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the carbon fixation operon, including carboxysome subunits, corresponding with significantly fewer carboxysome structures observed by electron microscopy. Prochlorococcus co-culture responsive gene 1 had significantly increased expression in elevated CO2, potentially indicating a shift in the microbial interaction. Transcriptome analysis of Alteromonas in co-culture with Prochlorococcus revealed decreased expression of the catalase gene, known to be critical in relieving oxidative stress in Prochlorococcus by removing hydrogen peroxide. The decrease in catalase gene expression was corroborated by a significant {\textasciitilde}6-fold decrease in removal rates of hydrogen peroxide from co-cultures. These data suggest Prochlorococcus may be more vulnerable to oxidative stress under elevated CO2 in part from a decrease in ecosystem services provided by heterotrophs like Alteromonas. This work highlights the importance of considering microbial interactions in the context of a changing ocean.},

The light-saturated capacity for PS I cyclic electron transport increased relative to chlorophyll concentration, PSI concentration, and linear electron transport capacity as growth light intensity was raised. In cells grown under moderate to high light intensity, PS I cyclic electron transport was nearly insensitive to methyl viologen, indicating that the cyclic electron supply to PS I derived almost exclusively from a thylakoid dehydrogenase. In cells grown under low light intensity, PSI cyclic electron transport was partially inhibited by methyl viologen, indicating that part of the cyclic electron supply to PSI derived directly from ferredoxin. It is proposed that the increased PSI cyclic electron transport observed in cells grown under high light intensity is a response to chronic photoinhibition.},

However, differences in the sequences of the alpha and beta chains compared with known PE subunits and the presence of a single bilin attachment site on the alpha subunit designate it as a novel PE type, which we propose naming PE-III. P. marinus is the sole prokaryotic organisms known so far that contains chlorophylls a and b as well as phycobilins. These data strongly suggest that the common ancestor of prochlorophytes and the Synechococcus cyanobacteria contained phycobilins.

Time courses at 830 nm for the enzyme alone reacting with O2 reveal complex kinetics for the oxidation of CuA. The time course begins with a lag phase, which becomes progressively shorter as the O2 concentration is increased. When cytochrome c is included the lag phase is extended. Cytochrome c oxidation proceeds to a level of 80\% in 5 milleseconds, and it is possible to resolve two rates over this time range. The dependence of these rates upon O2 concentration is reported here. The second, slower phase is rate-limited at a first-order value of 500 sec-1 at or above 200 microM O2. In contrast, the initial phase is proportional to O2 up to the highest O2 concentration used here (i.e. 340 microM) and reaches a rate of 6500 sec-1. In addition the time course of cytochrome c oxidation begins immediately (i.e., without a lag). It is proposed that the fast phase of cytochrome c oxidation is the result of electron transfer to O2, either via CuA or direct to the oxygen binding site. These pathways for electron transfer are not observed in the reductive half-reaction and may be the result of a conformational change in the oxidase that lowers a kinetic barrier to electron transfer present in the oxidized enzyme.},

Several studies propose that changes in visual predation will become a major climate-change impact on polar marine ecosystems. The High Arctic experiences extreme seasonality in the light environment, from 24 h light to 24 h darkness, and therefore provides a natural laboratory for studying light and predation risk over diel to seasonal timescales. Here, we show that zooplankton (observed using acoustics) in an Arctic fjord position themselves vertically in relation to light. A single isolume (depth-varying line of constant light intensity, the value of which is set at the lower limit of photobehaviour reponses of Calanus spp. and krill) forms a ceiling on zooplankton distribution. The vertical distribution is structured by light across timescales, from the deepening of zooplankton populations at midday as the sun rises in spring, to the depth to which zooplankton ascend to feed during diel vertical migration. These results suggest that zooplankton might already follow a foraging strategy that will keep visual predation risk roughly constant under changing light conditions, such as those caused by the reduction of sea ice, but likely with energetic costs such as lost feeding opportunities as a result of altered habitat use.},

Here, we show with a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model that the vibrational modes of the water molecule delineate five spectral niches, in the violet, blue, green, orange and red parts of the spectrum. These five niches are effectively captured by chlorophylls and phycobilin pigments of cyanobacteria and their eukaryotic descendants. Global distributions of the spectral niches are predicted by satellite remote sensing and validated with observed large-scale distribution patterns of cyanobacterial pigment types. Our findings provide an elegant explanation for the biogeographical distributions of photosynthetic pigments across the lakes and oceans of our planet.},

Fatty acids are also exported to the endoplasmic reticulum and incorporated into lipids that are redistributed to the chloroplast (eukaryotic lipids). MGDG, DGDG, SQDG, and PG establish the thylakoid membranes and are integral constituents of the photosynthetic complexes. Phosphate deprivation induces phospholipid degradation accompanied by the increase in DGDG, SQDG, and GlcADG. During freezing and drought stress, envelope membranes are stabilized by the conversion of MGDG into oligogalactolipids. Senescence and chlorotic stress lead to lipid and chlorophyll degradation and the deposition of acyl and phytyl moieties as fatty acid phytyl esters.},

As other variables become more readily available, both from remote sensing and in situ au5 tonomous platforms, we should ask if other indices of biomass might be preferable. Herein, we compare the accuracy of different proxies of phytoplankton biomass for estimating the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) and the initial slope of the production versus irradiance (P vs. E) curve ({$\alpha$}). The proxies compared are: the total chlorophyll a concentration (Tchla, the sum of chlorophyll a and divinyl chlorophyll), the phytoplank10 ton absorption coefficient, the phytoplankton photosynthetic absorption coefficient, the active fluorescence in situ, the particulate scattering coefficient at 650 nm (bp (650)), and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 650 nm (bbp(650)). All of the data (about 170 P vs. E curves) were collected in the South Pacific Ocean. We find that when only the phytoplanktonic biomass proxies are available, bp (650) and Tchla are 15 respectively the best estimators of Pmax and alpha. When additional variables are available, such as the depth of sampling, the irradiance at depth, or the temperature, Tchla becomes the best estimator of both Pmax and {$\alpha$}. From a remote sensing perspective, error propagation analysis shows that, given the current algorithms errors for estimating bbp(650), Tchla remains the best estimator of Pmax.},

  abstract = {Crocosphaera is a major dinitrogen (N2)-fixing microorganism, providing bioavailable nitrogen (N) to marine ecosystems. The N2-fixing enzyme nitrogenase is deactivated by oxygen (O2), which is abundant in marine environments. Using a cellular scale model of Crocosphaera sp. and laboratory data, we quantify the role of three O2 management strategies by Crocosphaera sp.: size adjustment, reduced O2 diffusivity, and respiratory protection. Our model predicts that Crocosphaera cells increase their size under high O2. Using transmission electron microscopy, we show that starch granules and thylakoid membranes are located near the cytoplasmic membranes, forming a barrier for O2. The model indicates a critical role for respiration in protecting the rate of N2 fixation. Moreover, the rise in respiration rates and the decline in ambient O2 with temperature strengthen this mechanism in warmer water, providing a physiological rationale for the observed niche of Crocosphaera at temperatures exceeding 20{$^\circ$}C. Our new measurements of the sensitivity to light intensity show that the rate of N2 fixation reaches saturation at a lower light intensity (ϳ100 ␮mol mϪ2 sϪ1) than photosynthesis and that both are similarly inhibited by light intensities of Ͼ500 ␮mol mϪ2 sϪ1. This suggests an explanation for the maximum population of Crocosphaera occurring slightly below the ocean surface.},

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the genetic diversity of rpoC1 gene fragments of Prochlorococcus at 12 sampling sites revealed a latitudinal pattern in Prochlorococcus RFLP-type diversity in the samples collected from two depths. At the depth to which 14\% of surface irradiance penetrated, HLII clones dominated the stations closest to the equator. The percentage of HLI clones increased with distance from the equator and LL clones were found only at the most northern and southern stations. In contrast, deeper (1\% light depth) water samples did not show any overall trend in Prochlorococcus diversity or clade dominance. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that Prochlorococcus diversity was linked to water temperature (partially an effect of latitude) and depth (which was linked to light penetration and turbidity). Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from the 423 different environmental RFLP-types detected in this study indicated that the HLII and HLI populations were composed of a wide range of genetically different clones, while the LL Prochlorococcus clade was less diverse, although half of the samples screened in this study derived from the 1\% light depth.},

  abstract = {Photosystem (PS) II is a multisubunit thylakoid membrane pigment--protein complex responsible for light-driven oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. Currently more than 40 proteins are known to associate with PSII, either stably or transiently. The inherent feature of the PSII complex is its vulnerability in light, with the damage mainly targeted to one of its core proteins, the D1 protein. The repair of the damaged D1 protein, i.e. the repair cycle of PSII, initiates in the grana stacks where the damage generally takes place, but subsequently continues in non-appressed thylakoid domains, where many steps are common for both the repair and de novo assembly of PSII. The sequence of the (re)assembly steps of genuine PSII subunits is relatively well-characterized in higher plants. A number of novel findings have shed light into the regulation mechanisms of lateral migration of PSII subcomplexes and the repair as well as the (re)assembly of the complex. Besides the utmost importance of the PSII repair cycle for the maintenance of PSII functionality, recent research has pointed out that the maintenance of PSI is closely dependent on regulation of the PSII repair cycle. This review focuses on the current knowledge of regulation of the repair cycle of PSII in higher plant chloroplasts. Particular emphasis is paid on sequential assembly steps of PSII and the function of the number of PSII auxiliary proteins involved both in the biogenesis and repair of PSII.

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

The rate of acetylene reduction in the dark increased with increasing oxygen concentrations until a maximum value was reached at 300 {$\mu$}M O2 (corresponding to 30\% O2 in the gas phase at 35{$^\circ$}C). This presumably results from a requirement for energy provided by respiration. Measurements of the dependence of respiration rate on dissolved oxygen concentration were made under comparable conditions using an open system to allow conditions close to steady-state to be obtained. The respiration rate of diazotrophically grown Anabaena variabilis had a dependence on oxygen concentration corresponding to the sum of two activities. These had Km values of 1.0 {$\mu$}M and 69 {$\mu$}M and values of Vmax of similar magnitude. Only the high affinity activity was observed in nitrate-grown cyanobacteria lacking heterocysts, and this presumably represent activity in the vegetative cells. The oxygen concentration dependence of the low affinity activity resembled that for the stimulation of acetylene reduction. We interpret this as the result of oxygen uptake by the heterocysts. The results are consistent with the idea that in intact filaments of cyanobacteria O2 enters heterocysts much more slowly than it enters the vegetative cells.},

Aquatic microalgae have low access to CO2, an essential carbon source for photosynthetic assimilates; however, 70--90 mol\% of their membrane lipids are sugar-derived lipids (glycolipids) such as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). In this study, we discovered a new system of membrane lipid remodeling responding to CO2 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a unicellular, freshwater cyanobacterium. As compared with higher CO2 (HC; 1\% CO2), under ambient air (lower CO2: LC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content was increased at the expense of MGDG content. To explore the biological significance of this alteration in content, we generated a transformant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 overexpressing sll0545 gene encoding a putative phosphatidic acid phosphate (oxPAP), which produces diacylglycerol that is used for the synthesis of glycolipids, and examined the effect on membrane lipid remodeling and phototrophic growth responding to LC. Photosystem II (PSII) activity and growth rate were inhibited under LC in oxPAP cells. PG content was substantially reduced, and MGDG and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol contents were increased in oxPAP cells as compared with control cells. These phenotypes in oxPAP cells were recovered under the HC condition or PG supplementation. Increased PG content may be required for proper functioning of PSII under LC conditions.},

These secondary peaks were most prominent during the early NE monsoon in the central oligotrophic portion of the Arabian Sea, although they were spatially and temporally variable. Based on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and flow cytometry analyses, SFM were determined to be populated almost exclusively by the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus spp. While SFM were about half the magnitude of primary fluorescence peaks, chlorophyll a biomass was typically an order of magnitude less than at the primary maxima (although total chlorophyll (a+b) differed only by a factor of two). Photosynthesis versus irradiance response curves revealed an efficient population adapted to extremely low light ({$\sim$}0.02--0.05\% surface irradiance) largely through increased light absorption capabilities. A theoretical spectral irradiance absorption efficiency model based on available spectral irradiance, individual cell properties, and bulk particulate spectral absorption also supports a well-adapted low-light population. Deck-incubated C-14 uptake as well as dilution growth experiments revealed instantaneous growth rates on the order of {$\mu$}=0.01d-1. However, additional in situ observations suggest SFM populations may be more dynamic than the growth rates estimates from shipboard bottle incubations predict. We advance four hypotheses for the regulation of SFM populations including: (1) reduced loss rates, (2) discontinuous environmental conditions, (3) enhanced sub-oxic growth, and (4) physical mechanisms.},

Exposure of cells to a PPFD of 1500 {$\mu$}mol m-2 s-1 induced 75\% photoinhibition of oxygen evolution of PS II within 2 h. In spite of severe photoinhibition, only a slight net decrease was observed at the steady-state level of the D1 protein as determined by quantitative immunoblotting analysis. However, in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors degradation of the D1 protein occurred rapidly and photoinhibition of PS II was accelerated. Pulse and chase experiments under strong illumination revealed that the D1 protein turned over rapidly with a half-life of about 30 min. The presence or absence of psbA mRNA carrying polyribosomes on the thylakoid membranes did not significantly affect the rate of D1 protein degradation. Our results indicate that no direct synchronization exists between degradation and synthesis of the D1 protein and it is probable that reassembly and activation of PS II after insertion of a new copy of the D1 protein to the PS II complex are the rate-limiting factors of the repair of photodamaged PS II in cyanobacteria. Northern blot analysis of psbA mRNA in the presence and absence of protein synthesis inhibitors demonstrated that protein factors are needed to regulate the expression of the psbA genes in Synechocystis 6803.},

  abstract = {Within the eastern tropical oceans of the Atlantic and Pacific basin vast oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) exist in the depth range between 100 and 900m. Minimum oxygen values are reached at 300--500m depth which in the eastern Pacific become suboxic (dissolved oxygen content {$<$}4.5{$\mu$}molkg-1) with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 1{$\mu$}molkg-1. The OMZ of the eastern Atlantic is not suboxic and has relatively high oxygen minimum values of about 17{$\mu$}molkg-1 in the South Atlantic and more than 40{$\mu$}molkg-1 in the North Atlantic. About 20 (40\%) of the North Pacific volume is occupied by an OMZ when using 45{$\mu$}molkg-1 (or 90{$\mu$}molkg-1, respectively) as an upper bound for OMZ oxygen concentration for ocean densities lighter than {$\sigma\theta<$}27.2kgm-3. The relative volumes reduce to less than half for the South Pacific (7\% and 13\%, respectively). The abundance of OMZs are considerably smaller (1\% and 7\%) for the South Atlantic and only {$\sim$}0\% and 5\% for the North Atlantic. Thermal domes characterized by upward displacements of isotherms located in the northeastern Pacific and Atlantic and in the southeastern Atlantic are co-located with the centres of the OMZs. They seem not to be directly involved in the generation of the OMZs. OMZs are a consequence of a combination of weak ocean ventilation, which supplies oxygen, and respiration, which consumes oxygen. Oxygen consumption can be approximated by the apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). However, AOU scaled with an appropriate consumption rate (aOUR) gives a time, the oxygen age. Here we derive oxygen ages using climatological AOU data and an empirical estimate of aOUR. Averaging oxygen ages for main thermocline isopycnals of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean exhibit an exponential increase with density without an obvious signature of the OMZs. Oxygen supply originates from a surface outcrop area and can also be approximated by the turn-over time, the ratio of ocean volume to ventilating flux. The turn-over time corresponds well to the average oxygen ages for the well ventilated waters. However, in the density ranges of the suboxic OMZs the turn-over time substantially increases. This indicates that reduced ventilation in the outcrop is directly related to the existence of suboxic OMZs, but they are not obviously related to enhanced consumption indicated by the oxygen ages. The turn-over time suggests that the lower thermocline of the North Atlantic would be suboxic but at present this is compensated by the import of water from the well ventilated South Atlantic. The turn-over time approach itself is independent of details of ocean transport pathways. Instead the geographical location of the OMZ is to first order determined by: (i) the patterns of upwelling, either through Ekman or equatorial divergence, (ii) the regions of general sluggish horizontal transport at the eastern boundaries, and (iii) to a lesser extent to regions with high productivity as indicated through ocean colour data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are responsible for around 10\% of global net primary productivity, serving as part of the foundation of marine food webs. Heterotrophic bacteria are often co-isolated with these picocyanobacteria in seawater enrichment cultures that contain no added organic carbon; heterotrophs grow on organic carbon supplied by the photolithoautotrophs. For examining the selective pressures shaping autotroph/heterotroph interactions, we have made use of unialgal enrichment cultures of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus maintained for hundreds to thousands of generations in the lab. We examine the diversity of heterotrophs in 74 enrichment cultures of these picocyanobacteria obtained from diverse areas of the global oceans. RESULTS: Heterotroph community composition differed between clades and ecotypes of the autotrophic 'hosts' but there was significant overlap in heterotroph community composition across these cultures. Collectively, the cultures were comprised of many shared taxa, even at the genus level. Yet, observed differences in community composition were associated with time since isolation, location, depth, and methods of isolation. The majority of heterotrophs in the cultures are rare in the global ocean, but enrichment conditions favor the opportunistic outgrowth of these rare bacteria. However, we found a few examples, such as bacteria in the family Rhodobacteraceae, of heterotrophs that were ubiquitous and abundant in cultures and in the global oceans. We found their abundance in the wild is also positively correlated with that of picocyanobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Particular conditions surrounding isolation have a persistent effect on long-term culture composition, likely from bottlenecking and selection that happen during the early stages of enrichment for the picocyanobacteria. We highlight the potential for examining ecologically relevant relationships by identifying patterns of distribution of culture-enriched organisms in the global oceans.},

  abstract = {The globally abundant marine Cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus share many physiological traits but presumably have different evolutionary histories and associated phylogeography. In Prochlorococcus, there is a clear phylogenetic hierarchy of ecotypes, whereas multiple Synechococcus clades have overlapping physiologies and environmental distributions. However, microbial traits are associated with different phylogenetic depths. Using this principle, we reclassified diversity at different phylogenetic levels and compared the phylogeography. We sequenced the genetic diversity of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus from 339 samples across the tropical Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean using a highly variable phylogenetic marker gene (rpoC1). We observed clear parallel niche distributions of ecotypes leading to high Pianka's Index values driven by distinct shifts at two transition points. The first transition point at 6{$^\circ$}N distinguished ecotypes adapted to warm waters but separated by macronutrient content. At 39{$^\circ$}N, ecotypes adapted to warm, low macronutrient vs. colder, high macronutrient waters shifted. Finally, we detected parallel vertical and regional single-nucleotide polymorphism microdiversity within clades from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, suggesting uniquely adapted populations at very specific depths, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Overall, this study demonstrates that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have shared phylogenetic organization of traits and associated phylogeography.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph. Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction, to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene. Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes, helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles, especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core. Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the ``leaves of the tree,'' between the most closely related strains. Finally, the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and the wild.},

Ccps are located in the periplasms of bacteria and the mitochondrial intermembrane spaces of fungi. In this study, Ccp is demonstrated to be a significant degrader of hydrogen peroxide in anoxic Escherichia coli. Intriguingly, ccp transcription requires both the presence of H2O2 and the absence of O2. Experiments show that Ccp lacks enough activity to shield the cytoplasm from exogenous H2O2. However, it receives electrons from the quinone pool, and its flux rate approximates flow to other anaerobic electron acceptors. Indeed, Ccp enabled E. coli to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source when H2O2 was supplied. Salmonella behaved similarly. This role rationalizes ccp repression in oxic environments. We speculate that micromolar H2O2 is created both biologically and abiotically at natural oxic/anoxic interfaces. The OxyR response appears to exploit this H2O2 as a terminal oxidant while simultaneously defending the cell against its toxicity.},

Here, we show that D5D/D6D provide a mechanism for glycolytic NAD+ recycling that permits ongoing glycolysis and cell viability when the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is reduced, analogous to lactate fermentation. Although lesser in magnitude than lactate production, this desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling is acutely adaptive when aerobic respiration is impaired in vivo. Notably, inhibition of either HUFA synthesis or lactate fermentation increases the other, underscoring their interdependence. Consistent with this, a type 2 diabetes risk haplotype in SLC16A11 that reduces pyruvate transport (thus limiting lactate production) increases D5D/D6D activity in vitro and in humans, demonstrating a chronic effect of desaturase-mediated NAD+ recycling. These findings highlight key biologic roles for D5D/D6D activity independent of their HUFA end products and expand the current paradigm of glycolytic NAD+ regeneration.},

This process enables the adaptation of cyanobacteria to various habitats, particularly in CO2-limited environments. Although CCM of freshwater and marine cyanobacteria are well studied, there is limited information on the CCM of cyanobacteria living under alkaline environments. Here, we aimed to explore the molecular components of CCM in 12 alkaliphilic cyanobacteria through genome-based analysis. These cyanobacteria included 6 moderate alkaliphiles; Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, Synechococcus spp., Cyanobacterium spp., Spirulina subsalsa PCC 9445, and 6 strong alkaliphiles (i.e. Arthrospira spp.). The results showed that both groups belong to {$\beta$}-cyanobacteria based on {$\beta$}-carboxysome shell proteins with form 1B of Rubisco. They also contained standard genes, ccmKLMNO cluster, which is essential for {$\beta$}-carboxysome formation. Most strains did not have the high-affinity Na+/HCO3- symporter SbtA and the medium-affinity ATP-dependent HCO3- transporter BCT1. Specifically, all strong alkaliphiles appeared to lack BCT1. Beside the transport systems, carboxysomal {$\beta$}-CA, CcaA, was absent in all alkaliphiles, except for three moderate alkaliphiles: Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, Cyanobacteriumstranieri PCC 7202, and Spirulina subsalsa PCC 9445. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the CCM components among freshwater, marine, and alkaliphilic {$\beta$}-cyanobacteria revealed that the basic molecular components of the CCM in the alkaliphilic cyanobacteria seemed to share more degrees of similarity with freshwater than marine cyanobacteria. These findings provide a relationship between the CCM components of cyanobacteria and their habitats.},

In the non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the size and function of thylakoid membranes are reduced under nitrogen (N) starvation but are quickly recovered after N addition to the starved cells. To understand how the functionality of thylakoid membranes are adjusted in response to N status in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we examined changes in thylakoid components and the photosynthetic activity during the N starvation and recovery processes. In N-starved cells, phycobilisome content, photosystem II protein levels and the photosynthetic activity substantially decreased as compared with those in N-sufficient cells. Although the content of chlorophyll (Chl) a, total protein and total glycerolipid also decreased under the N-starved condition based on OD730 reflecting cell density, when based on culture volume, the Chl a and total protein content remained almost constant and total glycerolipid content even increased during N starvation, suggesting that cellular levels of these components decrease under the N-starved condition mainly through dilution due to cell growth. With N addition, the photosynthetic activity quickly recovered, followed by full restoration of photosynthetic pigment and protein levels. The content of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), an essential lipid constituent of both photosystems, increased faster than that of Chl a, whereas the content of glycolipids, the main constituents of the thylakoid lipid bilayer, gradually recovered after N addition. The data indicate differential regulation of PG and glycolipids during the construction of the photosynthetic machinery and regeneration of thylakoid membranes. Of note, addition of PG to the growth medium slightly accelerated the Chl a accumulation in wild-type cells during the recovery process. Because PG is required for the biosynthesis of Chl a and the formation of functional photosystem complexes, rapid PG biosynthesis in response to N acquisition may be required for the rapid formation of the photosynthetic machinery during thylakoid regeneration.},

  abstract = {Unicellular cyanobacteria constitute a substantial, ecologically important part of freshwater and marine microflora. Solitary, elongated cyanobacterial cells without apparent slime envelopes and dividing in a single plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis were traditionally classified into the genus Synechococcus. The type species originates from a freshwater benthic habitat while a number of other Synechococcus-like species were described from diverse environments. Morphologically similar, unicellular populations of "Synechococcus" belong to the most abundant oxygen evolving prokaryotes inhabiting freshwater and oceanic picoplanktic communities. Other species from extreme thermal habitats were described from temperatures over 70 {$^\circ$}C. Recent molecular analyses, particularly the 16S rRNA gene and other multi-locus gene based phylogenies of Synechococcus-like species reveal the polyphyly and phylogenetic diversity of such simple cyanobacteria emphasizing the necessity of their accurate polyphasic taxonomic re-classification. To better understand the phylogeny of different Synechococcus-like species, we constructed a genome-derived phylogenetic tree using 133 cyanobacterial and eubacterial genomes as well as a 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree. Both trees indicate existence of deep splits between individual Synechococcus lineages corresponding with indistinct ecological and cytomorphological differences. The generic units derived from the traditional concept of the genus Synechococcus based on the combined traits and markers must be defined and validly described. The comparative taxonomic classification of phylogenetic clusters corresponding to various morphotypes and genotypes similar to the genus Synechococcus (Cyanobium, Parasynechococcus, Picosynechococcus, Prochlorococcus, Thermosynechococcus, Thermostichus) are discussed in the article.},

  abstract = {The selective replacement of photodamaged D1 protein within the multisubunit photosystem II (PSII) complex is an important photoprotective mechanism in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. FtsH proteases are involved at an early stage of D1 degradation, but it remains unclear how the damaged D1 subunit is recognized, degraded, and replaced. To test the role of the N-terminal region of D1 in PSII biogenesis and repair, we have constructed mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 that are truncated at the exposed N terminus. Removal of 5 or 10 residues blocked D1 synthesis, as assessed in radiolabeling experiments, whereas removal of 20 residues restored the ability to assemble oxygen-evolving dimeric PSII complexes but inhibited PSII repair at the level of D1 degradation. Overall, our results identify an important physiological role for the exposed N-terminal tail of D1 at an early step in selective D1 degradation. This finding has important implications for the recognition of damaged D1 and its synchronized replacement by a newly synthesized subunit.},

Polar lipids separated include: the phosphoglycerolipids PG, PE, PI, PS, PC and LPC; the galactoglycerolipids MGDG and DGDG; and a sulfoglycerolipid SQDG. Neutral lipids include TAG, DAG, and MAG classes and sub-classes containing 0--3, 0--2, and 0--1 hydroxy fatty acids, respectively. The hexane/isopropanol/ methanol/aqueous system separates polar lipids without the use of chloroform such that it is suitable for radioactivity analysis by in-line flow scintillation counting. Each method was optimized using the natural lipid standards comprised of diverse molecular species that were detected by ELSD. All molecular species of each lipid class eluted together as single peak detected by ELSD. The methods were demonstrated to be suitable for resolving lipid extracts from animal, microbial, and plant sources as well as application to 14C based metabolic tracing of lipid metabolism in leaves and seeds.},

The model is based on the mechanism of oxygen reduction and linked proton translocation postulated by Wikstr{\"o}m and Verkhovsky (2007). It enables the calculation of the steady-state turnover rates and enzyme-state populations as functions of the cytochrome c reduction state, oxygen concentration, membrane potential, and pH on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We use the model to explain the enigmatic decrease in oxygen affinity of the enzyme that has been observed in mitochondria when the proton-motive force is increased. The importance of the 26 transitions in the mechanism of cytochrome oxidase for the functional properties of cytochrome oxidase is compared through Metabolic Control Analysis. The control of the KM value is distributed mainly between the steps in the mechanism that involve electrogenic proton movements, with both positive and negative contributions. Positive contributions derive from the same steps that control enzyme turnover rate in the model. Limitations and possible further applications of the model are discussed.},

The genome of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes four FtsH homologs designated FtsH1-4. The FtsH3 homolog is present in two hetero-oligomeric complexes: FtsH2/FtsH3, which is responsible for photosystem II quality control, and the essential FtsH1/FtsH3 complex, which helps maintain Fe homeostasis by regulating the level of the transcription factor Fur. To gain a more comprehensive insight into the physiological roles of FtsH hetero-complexes, we carried out genome-wide expression profiling and global proteomic analyses of Synechocystis mutants conditionally depleted of FtsH3 or FtsH1 grown under various nutrient conditions. We show that the lack of FtsH1/3 leads to a drastic reduction in the transcriptional response to nutrient stress of not only Fur but also the Pho, NdhR, and NtcA, regulons. In addition, this effect is accompanied by the accumulation of the respective transcription factors. Thus, the FtsH1/3 complex is of critical importance for acclimation to iron, phosphate, carbon, and nitrogen starvation in Synechocystis.},

  abstract = {In situ viability of oceanic phytoplankton may be relatively low in open oceans. This is assumed to be related to the high-irradiance and low-nutrient conditions typical for oligotrophic regions. However, experimental evidence for this phenomenon was not yet available. In the present study, the importance of nutrient availability in highirradiance--induced viability loss was therefore studied for three key oceanic phytoplankton species. Prochlorococcus marinus, Ostreococcus sp., and Thalassiosira oceanica were acclimated to two different N : P ratios. Growth, viability, and photophysiology were assessed under nutrient-replete and N- and P-starved conditions. Simultaneously, high-irradiance--induced photoinhibition and viability loss were measured and three inhibitors were used to investigate the underlying physiological mechanisms contributing to viability loss. Highirradiance exposure caused viability loss in P. marinus and Ostreococcus sp., but not in T. oceanica. Low-nutrient availability enhanced survival during high-irradiance exposure, although species-specific differences were observed. The lower sensitivity to high-irradiance intensities at low-nutrient availability was related to conformational changes in photosystem II in P. marinus, to enhanced photoprotection by the xanthophyll pigment cycle and alternative electron transport in Ostreococcus sp., and to enhanced photoprotection by the xanthophyll pigment cycle in T. oceanica. Climate change may lead to enhanced stratification in the open ocean. The resulting increase in the average irradiance intensity phytoplankton experience may promote viability loss in the smallest phytoplankton size fraction. However, this effect may partially be counteracted by the simultaneously expected decrease in nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis takes place in thylakoid membranes (TM) of cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. It begins with light absorption by pigments in large (modular) assemblies of pigment-binding proteins, which then transfer excitation energy to the photosynthetic reaction centers of photosystem (PS) I and PSII. In green algae and plants, these light-harvesting protein complexes contain chlorophylls (Chls) and carotenoids (Cars). However, cyanobacteria, red algae, and glaucophytes contain, in addition, phycobiliproteins in phycobilisomes that are attached to the stromal surface of TM, and transfer excitation energy to the reaction centers via the Chl a molecules in the inner antenna of PSI and PSII. The color and the intensity of the light to which these photosynthetic organisms are exposed in their environment have a great influence on the composition and the structure of the light-harvesting complexes (the antenna) as well as the rest of the photosynthetic apparatus, thus affecting the photosynthetic process and even the entire organism. We present here a perspective on `Light Quality and Oxygenic Photosynthesis', in memory of George Christos Papageorgiou (9 May 1933--21 November 2020; see notes a and b). Our review includes (1) the influence of the solar spectrum on the antenna composition, and the special significance of Chl a; (2) the effects of light quality on photosynthesis, measured using Chl a fluorescence; and (3) the importance of light quality, intensity, and its duration for the optimal growth of photosynthetic organisms.},

But day length, or day length changes,per se, do not explain the latitudinal variations of observed cycles in a consistent manner. A standardization of day length with latitude, based on the extreme photoperiods at each latitude, yields a ``relative day length'' parameter in two sets. It is suggested that these sets are applicable in the description of photoperiodic effects at different latitudes for ``long-day'' and ``short-day'' organisms. The aptness of the descriptive parameters is demonstrated for the egg seasons of certain birds, and for the reproductive cycle of white-tailed deer. In both instances, breeding season peaks occur at the same relative day length at all latitudes.},

While much of the research on climate change has focused on rapid shifts in temperature, far less attention has focused on the effects of changes in environmental salinity. Consequently, predictive studies on the physiological, evolutionary, and migratory responses of organisms and populations to the threats of salinity change are relatively lacking. This omission represents a major oversight, given that salinity is among the most important factors that define biogeographic boundaries in aquatic habitats. In this perspective, we briefly touch on responses of organisms and populations to rapid changes in salinity occurring on contemporary time scales. We then discuss factors that might confer resilience to certain taxa, enabling them to survive rapid salinity shifts. Next, we consider approaches for predicting how geographic distributions will shift in response to salinity change. Finally, we identify additional data that are needed to make better predictions in the future. Future studies on climate change should account for the multiple environmental factors that are rapidly changing, especially habitat salinity.},

Through numerical simulations of optically deep waters covering a wide range of optical properties, it is found that the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling USR, Kd(USR), is nearly a constant vertically for almost all oceanic waters (chlorophyll concentration under {$\sim$}3 mg m-3). This feature is quite contrary to the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetic available radiation, K(PAR), which varies significantly from surface to deeper depths for oceanic waters. It is also found that the ratio of the photosynthetic utilizable radiation (PUR) to the product of USR and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 440 nm approximates a constant for most oceanic waters. These results support the use of a single Kd(USR) for each water and each sun angle for accurate estimation of USR propagation, and suggest an efficient approach to estimate PUR(z) in the upper water column. These results further indicate that it is necessary and valuable for the generation of USR and Kd(USR) products from satellite ocean color measurements, which can be used to facilitate the studies of heat transfer and photosynthesis in the global oceans.},

  abstract = {Light drives phytoplankton productivity, so phytoplankton must exploit variable intensities and durations of light exposure, depending upon season, latitude, and depth. We analyzed the growth, photophysiology and composition of small, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and large, Thalassiosira punctigera, centric diatoms from temperate, coastal marine habitats, responding to a matrix of photoperiods and growth light intensities. T. pseudonana showed fastest growth rates under long photoperiods and low to moderate light intensities, while the larger T. punctigera showed fastest growth rates under short photoperiods and higher light intensities. Photosystem II function and content responded primarily to instantaneous growth light intensities during the photoperiod, while diel carbon fixation and RUBISCO content responded more to photoperiod duration than to instantaneous light intensity. Changing photoperiods caused species-specific changes in the responses of photochemical yield (e-/photon) to growth light intensity. These photophysiological variables showed complex responses to photoperiod and to growth light intensity. Growth rate also showed complex responses to photoperiod and growth light intensity. But these complex responses resolved into a close relation between growth rate and the cumulative daily generation of reductant, across the matrix of photoperiods and light intensities.},

In addition to this net synthesis, oxygenic photoautotrophs must counter the light-dependent photoinactivation of Photosystem II (PSII), using metabolically expensive proteolysis, disassembly, resynthesis and re-assembly of protein subunits. We used growth rates, elemental analyses and protein quantitations to estimate the nitrogen (N) metabolism costs to both accumulate the photosynthetic system and to maintain PSII function in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, growing at two pCO2 levels across a range of light levels. The photosynthetic system contains c. 15--25\% of total cellular N. Under low growth light, N (re)cycling through PSII repair is only c. 1\% of the cellular N assimilation rate. As growth light increases to inhibitory levels, N metabolite cycling through PSII repair increases to c. 14\% of the cellular N assimilation rate. Cells growing under the assumed future 750 ppmv pCO2 show higher growth rates under optimal light, coinciding with a lowered N metabolic cost to maintain photosynthesis, but then suffer greater photoinhibition of growth under excess light, coincident with rising costs to maintain photosynthesis. We predict this quantitative trait response to light will vary across taxa.},

Microorganisms play a central role in phosphorus cycling in the environment, and microbial activity may result in both equilibrium and kinetic fractionation of phosphate oxygen isotopes. In the present paper, we focus on kinetic fractionation induced by microbial phosphorus uptake. This type of fractionation may result in nonequilibrium {$\delta$}18OP values observed in some marine, freshwater, and terrestrial settings. We worked with the model cyanobacterium, Synechocystis PCC6803, which has two pst (phosphate specific transporter) type phosphate (PO4) transporters, each characterized by a different affinity for PO4. We found that PO4 uptake by Synechocystis in the P-uptake experiments induced fractionation when cells were P-limited. Moreover, under these conditions, Synechocystis preferentially took up the isotopically lighter P16O4. This resulted in a PO4--water oxygen isotope fractionation factor of -3.33 permil, similar to the value previously reported for Escherichia coli. Results from PO4 transporter mutants show that high affinity, and not low affinity, pst's were responsible for this fractionation. On the basis of our results, we suggest that the degree of kinetic fractionation induced by biological uptake is dependent on the type of transporter involved in the uptake process.},

The annual cycle of surface nutrients is characterized by a spring--summer biological drawdown and a fall--winter increase due to vertical mixing. The drawdown is accompanied by maximum oxygen supersaturations. In the subsurface layer (100--200m), the decrease of oxygen concentrations during the spring--summer period reflects the remineralization of organic matter. The spring--summer drawdown of surface nutrients implies new production rates that are high in the high latitudes (around 40gC/m2 on average), and low in the low and temperate latitudes (about 15gC/m2 on average). In the subsurface layer, respiration rates are computed from the oxygen concentration decrease during spring--summer period. Results show that most of the new production in the low latitudes, and half or less of it in the high latitudes, is remineralized above 200m. The spring--summer new production in the North Atlantic Ocean is 1.34PgC. Considering that the spring--summer production that is not mineralized in the top 200m of the ocean is mainly composed of particulate organic matter would lead to an export lying between 0.4 and 0.6GtC/period for the whole North Atlantic Ocean.},

Here, we study the effect of blue (450 nm), orange (625 nm), and red (660 nm) light on growth of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana and other cyanobacteria containing phycocyanin or phycoerythrin. Our results demonstrate that specific growth rates of the cyanobacteria were similar in orange and red light, but much lower in blue light. Conversely, specific growth rates of the green alga C. sorokiniana were similar in blue and red light, but lower in orange light. Oxygen production rates of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were five-fold lower in blue than in orange and red light at low light intensities but approached the same saturation level in all three colors at high light intensities. Measurements of 77 K fluorescence emission demonstrated a lower ratio of photosystem I to photosystem II (PSI:PSII ratio) and relatively more phycobilisomes associated with PSII (state 1) in blue light than in orange and red light. These results support the hypothesis that blue light, which is not absorbed by phycobilisomes, creates an imbalance between the two photosystems of cyanobacteria with an energy excess at PSI and a deficiency at the PSII-side of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. Our results help to explain why phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria use blue light less efficiently than species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae such as Prochlorococcus, green algae and terrestrial plants.},

  abstract = {The color of many lakes and seas is changing, which is likely to affect the species composition of freshwater and marine phytoplankton communities. For example, cyanobacteria with phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae can effectively utilize green or orange-red light. However, recent studies show that they use blue light much less efficiently than phytoplankton species with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes, even though both phytoplankton groups may absorb blue light to a similar extent. Can we advance ecological theory to predict how these differences in light-harvesting strategy affect competition between phytoplankton species? Here, we develop a new resource competition model in which the absorption and utilization efficiency of different colors of light are varied independently. The model was parameterized using monoculture experiments with a freshwater cyanobacterium and green alga, as representatives of phytoplankton with phycobilisome-based versus chlorophyll-based light-harvesting antennae. The parameterized model was subsequently tested in a series of competition experiments. In agreement with the model predictions, the green alga won the competition in blue light whereas the cyanobacterium won in red light, irrespective of the initial relative abundances of the species. These results are in line with observed changes in phytoplankton community structure in response to lake brownification. Similarly, in marine waters, the model predicts dominance of Prochlorococcus with chlorophyll-based light-harvesting complexes in blue light but dominance of Synechococcus with phycobilisomes in green light, with a broad range of coexistence in between. These predictions agree well with the known biogeographical distributions of these two highly abundant marine taxa. Our results offer a novel trait-based approach to understand and predict competition between phytoplankton species with different photosynthetic pigments and light-harvesting strategies.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton in high-light, low-nutrient ocean environments are challenged with maintaining high photosynthetic efficiency and simultaneously preventing photodamage that results from low levels of electron acceptors downstream of photosystem II (PSII). Here, we identify a process in open ocean picophytoplankton that preserves PSII activity by diverting electrons from the photosystem I (PSI) complex--mediated carbon assimilation to oxygen via a propyl gallate--sensitive oxidase associated with the photosynthetic electron transport chain. This process stabilizes diel photochemical efficiency of PSII, despite midday photoinhibition, by maintaining oxidized PSII reaction centers. Although measurements of the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, Fv : Fm show midday photoinhibition, midday CO2 fixation is not depressed. Moreover, CO2 fixation saturates at low irradiances even though PSII electron flow is not saturated at irradiances of 1,985 mmol photons m22 s21. This disparity between PSII fluorescence and CO2 fixation is consistent with the activity of an oxidase that serves as a terminal electron acceptor, maintaining oxidized PSII reaction centers even when CO2 fixation has saturated and the total number of functional reaction centers decreases because of photoinhibition (reflected in lower midday Fv : Fm values). This phenomenon is less apparent in coastal phytoplankton populations, suggesting that it is a strategy particularly distinctive of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic ocean. Spatial variability in features of photosynthetic electron flow could explain biogeographical differences in productivity throughout the ocean and should be represented in models that use empirical photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements from a limited number of ocean sites to estimate the productivity of the entire ocean.},

The rectangular hyperbolic model (RHM), non-rectangular hyperbolic model (NRHM), exponential model (EM) and modified rectangular hyperbolic model (MRHM) were used to model the photosynthetic light response curves. The fitting accuracy of these models was tested by comparing determinants coefficients (R2), mean square errors (MSE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The results showed that the mean value of R2 of MRHM (R2 = 0.9687) was the highest, whereas MSE value (MSE = 0.0748) and AIC value (AIC = -39.21) were the lowest. The order of fitting accuracy of the four models for Pn-PAR response curve was as follows: MRHM {$>$} EM {$>$} NRHM {$>$} RHM. In addition, the light saturation point (LSP) obtained by MRHM was slightly lower than the observed values, whereas the maximum net photosynthetic rates (Pmax) modeled by the four models were close to the measured values. Therefore, MRHM was superior to other three models in describing the photosynthetic response curve, the accurate values were that the quantum efficiency ({$\alpha$}), maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax), light saturation point (LSP), light compensation point (LCP) and respiration rate (Rd) were 0.06, 6.06 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}m-2s-1, 802.68 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}m-2s-1, 10.76 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}m-2s-1 and 0.60 {$\mu$}mol{$\cdot$}m-2s-1.

Ecotype abundance displayed weak seasonal fluctuations at HOT and strong seasonal fluctuations at BATS. Furthermore, stable `layered' depth distributions, where different Prochlorococcus ecotypes reached maximum abundance at different depths, were maintained consistently for 5 years at HOT. Layered distributions were also observed at BATS, although winter deep mixing events disrupted these patterns each year and produced large variations in ecotype abundance. Interestingly, the layered ecotype distributions were regularly reestablished each year after deep mixing subsided at BATS. In addition, Prochlorococcus ecotypes each responded differently to the strong seasonal changes in light, temperature and mixing at BATS, resulting in a reproducible annual succession of ecotype blooms. Patterns of ecotype abundance, in combination with physiological assays of cultured isolates, confirmed that the low-light adapted eNATL could be distinguished from other low-light adapted ecotypes based on its ability to withstand temporary exposure to high-intensity light, a characteristic stress of the surface mixed layer. Finally, total Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus dynamics were compared with similar time series data collected a decade earlier at each location. The two data sets were remarkably similar---testimony to the resilience of these complex dynamic systems on decadal time scales.},

Photoinhibitory quenching, qI, is sustained NPQ that continuously depresses the commonly used fluorescence parameter ``quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII)'', or Fv/Fm, and is often viewed as a result of PSII core inactivation due to D1 damage. Inactivated PSII cores might have a photoprotective role but that is not the topic of the present review.

Here, we show that FtsH from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii forms heterooligomers comprising two subunits, FtsH1 and FtsH2. We characterized this protease using FtsH mutants that we identified through a genetic suppressor approach that restored phototrophic growth of mutants originally defective for cytochrome b ~6 ~f accumulation. We thus extended the spectrum of FtsH substrates in the thylakoid membranes beyond photosystem II, showing the susceptibility of cytochrome b ~6 ~f complexes (and proteins involved in the c ~i heme binding pathway to cytochrome b ~6) to FtsH. We then show how FtsH is involved in the response of C. reinhardtii to macronutrient stress. Upon phosphorus starvation, photosynthesis inactivation results from an FtsH-sensitive photoinhibition process. In contrast, we identified an FtsH-dependent loss of photosystem II and cytochrome b ~6 ~f complexes in darkness upon sulfur deprivation. The D1 fragmentation pattern observed in the latter condition was similar to that observed in photoinhibitory conditions, which points to a similar degradation pathway in these two widely different environmental conditions. Our experiments thus provide extensive evidence that FtsH plays a major role in the quality control of thylakoid membrane proteins and in the response of C. reinhardtii to light and macronutrient stress.},

  abstract = {Many carbon-fixing bacteria rely on a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) to elevate the CO2 concentration around the carboxylating enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The CCM is postulated to simultaneously enhance the rate of carboxylation and minimize oxygenation, a competitive reaction with O2 also catalyzed by RuBisCO. To achieve this effect, the CCM combines two features: active transport of inorganic carbon into the cell and colocalization of carbonic anhydrase and RuBisCO inside proteinaceous microcompartments called carboxysomes. Understanding the significance of the various CCM components requires reconciling biochemical intuition with a quantitative description of the system. To this end, we have developed a mathematical model of the CCM to analyze its energetic costs and the inherent intertwining of physiology and pH. We find that intracellular pH greatly affects the cost of inorganic carbon accumulation. At low pH the inorganic carbon pool contains more of the highly cell-permeable H2CO3, necessitating a substantial expenditure of energy on transport to maintain internal inorganic carbon levels. An intracellular pH {$\approx$}8 reduces leakage, making the CCM significantly more energetically efficient. This pH prediction coincides well with our measurement of intracellular pH in a model cyanobacterium. We also demonstrate that CO2 retention in the carboxysome is necessary, whereas selective uptake of HCO3- into the carboxysome would not appreciably enhance energetic efficiency. Altogether, integration of pH produces a model that is quantitatively consistent with cyanobacterial physiology, emphasizing that pH cannot be neglected when describing biological systems interacting with inorganic carbon pools.},

Sea-level rise resulting from thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers is viewed as one of the main impacts of climate changes. A 0.5 m rise scenario for the year 2100 was used for this study. A modified version of the Brunn Rule was used to estimate land loss due to erosion. Land loss due to inundation was considered for the case of lowlands. According to the assessments performed, land loss due to erosion in the 5 coastal areas chosen for the study (20.07 km\textsuperscript{2}) would be less than that due to inundation (52.63 km\textsuperscript{2}). Oil infrastructure, urban areas, and tourist infrastructure, all of which are essential to the national economy, would be affected. The areas with more population at risk would be the Costa Oriental del Lago de Maracaibo (eastern coast of Maracaibo Lake) and Costa Oriental del Estado Falc{\'o}n (eastern coast of Falc{\'o}n State). The former has the highest capital value at risk, followed by Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz-Guanta. Assuming a {\textbackslash}'No Protection{\textbackslash}' response and a 0.5 m sea-level rise, approximately 131.13 km\textsuperscript{2 }would be lost. If the {\textbackslash}'Important Areas Protection{\textbackslash}' option was implemented, only 86.16 km\textsuperscript{2} (US\$ 15000 million) would be lost. The vulnerability of these coastal areas could be reduced by more appropriate planning and management.},

The social and economic long term monitoring program (SELTMP) for the Reef is a novel attempt to monitor the social and economic dimensions of social-ecological change in a globally and nationally important region. It represents the current status and condition of the major user groups of the Reef with the potential to simultaneously consider trends, interconnections, conflicts, dependencies and vulnerabilities. Our approach was to combine a well-established conceptual framework with a strong governance structure and partnership arrangement that enabled the co-production of knowledge. The framework is a modification of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and it was used to guide indicator choice. Indicators were categorised as; (i) resource use and dependency, (ii) ecosystem benefits and well-being, and (iii) drivers of change. Data were collected through secondary datasets where existing and new datasets were created where not, using standard survey techniques. Here we present an overview of baseline results of new survey data from commercial-fishers (n = 210), marine-based tourism operators (n = 119), tourists (n = 2877), local residents (n = 3181), and other Australians (n = 2002). The indicators chosen describe both social and economic components of the Reef system and represent an unprecedented insight into the ways in which people currently use and depend on the Reef, the benefits that they derive, and how they perceive, value and relate to the Reef and each other. However, the success of a program such as the SELTMP can only occur with well-translated cutting-edge data and knowledge that are collaboratively produced, adaptive, and directly feeds into current management processes. We discuss how data from the SELTMP have already been incorporated into Reef management decision-making through substantial inclusion in three key policy documents.}

We examined the organization of the phoB gene cluster in 11 Prochlorococcus strains belonging to diverse ecotypes and found high variability in gene content that was not congruent with rRNA phylogeny. We hypothesize that this genome variability is related to differences in P availability in the oceans from which the strains were isolated. Analysis of a metagenomic library from the Sargasso Sea supports this hypothesis; most Prochlorococcus cells in this low-P environment contain the P-acquisition genes seen in MED4, although a number of previously undescribed gene combinations were observed.}

Ninety-three per cent of the ITS sequences could be assigned to existing Prochlorococcus clades, although many novel subclades were detected. We assigned the sequences to operational taxonomic units using a graduated scale of sequence identity from 80\% to 99.5\% and correlated Prochlorococcus diversity with respect to environmental variables and dispersal time between the sites. Dispersal time was estimated using a global ocean circulation model. The significance of specific environmental variables was dependent on the degree of sequence identity used to define a taxon: light correlates with broad-scale diversity (90\% cut-off), temperature with intermediate scale (95\%) whereas no correlation with phosphate was observed. Community structure was correlated with dispersal time between sample sites only when taxa were defined using the finest sequence similarity cut-off. Surprisingly, the concentration of nitrate, which cannot be used as N source by the Prochlorococcus strains in culture, explains some variation in community structure for some definitions of taxa. This study suggests that the spatial distribution of Prochlorococcus ecotypes is shaped by a hierarchy of environmental factors as well dispersal limitation.},

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria constitute an ancient, diverse and ecologically important bacterial group. The responses of these organisms to light and nutrient conditions are finely controlled, enabling the cells to survive a range of environmental conditions. In particular, it is important to understand how cyanobacteria acclimate to the absorption of excess excitation energy and how stress-associated transcripts accumulate following transfer of cells from low- to high-intensity light. In this study, quantitative RT-PCR was used to monitor changes in levels of transcripts encoding chaperones and stress-associated proteases in three cyanobacterial strains that inhabit different ecological niches: the freshwater strain               Synechocystis               sp.

Levels of transcripts encoding stress-associated proteins were very sensitive to changes in light intensity in all of these organisms, although there were significant differences in the degree and kinetics of transcript accumulation. A specific set of genes that seemed to be associated with high-light adaptation (               groEL               /               groES               ,               dnaK2               ,               dnaJ3               ,               clpB1               and               clpP1               ) could be targeted for more detailed studies in the future.

These numbers are comparable to those found in the other marine picocyanobacteria but much lower than those found in freshwater cyanobacteria. Moreover, the diversity of these genes is low in Prochlorococcus since most histidine kinases are related to a single group (type I) and most response regulators to a single family (OmpR). Under standard conditions, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that one hik (hik03) and two rer (rer04 and rer05) genes were expressed at relatively high levels compared to the other two-component system genes. In response to high light exposure, a moderate increase (\&gt;5-fold) was observed in the expression of some putative rer genes (rer01, rer04, rer05, and rer06), whereas a smaller increase (\&lt;3-fold) in hik03 and hik04 mRNA levels was detected.

  abstract = {Light plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems, both marine and freshwater. Penetration of light underwater influences various biogeochemical processes and also influences activities and behavioral patterns of marine organisms. In addition, dissolved and particulate water constituents present in the water column absorb and scatter light, giving water its characteristic color. The concentration or abundance of these constituents, referred to as optically active constituents (OACs) also determine light availability underwater. Thus color being an indicator of water column content, serves as a water quality parameter. Monitoring of the ocean color variables, such as the OAC concentrations and their optical properties, therefore, allows assessment of the health of an ecosystem. Advances in optical methodologies have improved the understanding of our ecosystems through multispectral and hyperspectral in situ measurements and observations. However, the ocean environment is vast and dynamic and so limitations of spatial and temporal coverage have been overcome with satellite remote sensing that provides oceanographers with repeated synoptic coverage. Being recognized as an essential climate variable (ECV) ocean color is monitored as part of the climate change initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency (ESA). This chapter aims to provide the reader with an overview of the science of ocean color, introducing involved common terminologies and concepts and its global coverage using satellite remote sensing.},

  abstract = {In the Earth's geological record massive marine ecological change has been attributed to the occurrence of widespread anoxia in the ocean [Jahren, 2002; White, 2002; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996]. Climate change projection till the end of this century predict a 4 to 7\% decline in the dissolve oxygen in the ocean [Bopp et al., 2002; Matear et al., 2000; Plattner et al., 2001; Sarmiento et al., 1998] suggesting the potential for global warming to eventually drive the deep ocean anoxic. To examine the multicentury impact of protracted global warming on oceanic concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we use a climate system model and a low-order oceanic biogeochemical model. The models are integrated for an atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration, which is specified to triple according to a standard scenario from the late nineteenth to the late twenty-first century, and then is subsequently held constant at that elevated level for an additional 6 centuries. For the present day, the model successfully reproduced the large-scale features of the dissolved oxygen field in the ocean. In the global warming simulation, the physical model displays marked changes in high-latitude oceanic stratification and overturning, including near-cessation of deep water renewal for depths greater than about 1.5 km during the period of elevated stable CO2 concentration. Our model predicts a decline in oxygen concentration through most of the subsurface ocean. Concentration changes in the thermocline waters result mainly from solubility changes in the upstream source waters, while changes in the deep waters result mainly from lack of ventilation and ongoing consumption of oxygen by remineralization of sinking particulate organic matter. Changes in the upper 2 km of the ocean generally show signs of equilibration by the end of the integration, but at greater depths, there occurs a slow but steady decline through to the end of the integration. By the end of the integration, we simulate a doubling of the volume of hypoxic water (less than 10 {$\mu$}mol/kg) in the thermocline of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. During the integration deep ocean oxygen concentrations generally decline by between 20 and 40\%, but, significantly, no extensive deep ocean anoxia develops during the period of integration, nor does it appear that it would likely do so for at least a further 4000 years of integration. Subsurface oxygen decline is moderated by an overall reduction in export production of particulate organic matter, which reduces oxygen consumption in the ocean interior due to the remineralization of this material.},

  abstract = {The interannual variability and the mechanisms controlling the dissolved oxygen concentration in the Mediterranean Sea were investigated through generating gridded fields of dissolved oxygen, salinity and potential temperature. The Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) software was used to produce a gridded dataset for the time period 1960--2011. High oxygen concentrations for the upper and bottom layers, separated by an oxygen minimum zone at intermediate layers, are a typical structure of the dissolved oxygen in the Eastern and the Western Mediterranean sub-basins. Although an oxygen minimum zone is observed in both sub-basins, its vertical positions are different; in the Eastern Mediterranean at between 600 and 1200 m depth and in the Western Mediterranean at between 400 and 600~m. The vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen shows significant differences between the two sub-basins and their temporal evolution reveals large interannual to decadal variability. A negative correlation was observed between dissolved oxygen and surface potential temperature due to solubility changes over the whole period. However, the positive correlation between the dissolved oxygen and potential temperature in the Eastern Mediterranean deep layers is an indication that the dynamical processes are dominant and are involved in the dissolved oxygen interannual variability. The dissolved oxygen variability presents shifts with a multi-decadal signal, rather than trends as observed in the global ocean, associated with mixing processes and decadal oscillations that influence the dense water formation or biological activity.},

Although they require solar energy for photosynthesis, excess light and associated high UV radiations can induce high levels of oxidative stress that may have deleterious effects on their growth and productivity. Here, we compared the photophysiologies of the model strains Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803 grown under a bell-shaped light/dark cycle of high visible light supplemented or not with UV. Prochlorococcus exhibited a higher sensitivity to photoinactivation than Synechococcus under both conditions, as shown by a larger drop of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield at noon and different diel patterns of the D1 protein pool. In the presence of UV, the PSII repair rate was significantly depressed at noon in Prochlorococcus compared to Synechococcus. Additionally, Prochlorococcus was more sensitive than Synechococcus to oxidative stress, as shown by the different degrees of PSII photoinactivation after addition of hydrogen peroxide. A transcriptional analysis also revealed dramatic discrepancies between the two organisms in the diel expression patterns of several genes involved notably in the biosynthesis and/or repair of photosystems, light-harvesting complexes, CO2 fixation as well as protection mechanisms against light, UV, and oxidative stress, which likely translate profound differences in their light-controlled regulation. Altogether our results suggest that while Synechococcus has developed efficient ways to cope with light and UV stress, Prochlorococcus cells seemingly survive stressful hours of the day by launching a minimal set of protection mechanisms and by temporarily bringing down several key metabolic processes. This study provides unprecedented insights into understanding the distinct depth distributions and dynamics of these two picocyanobacteria in the field.},

Range shift velocities are higher in the marine environment, with observed rates of 30--130 km per decade. Both protected and exploited species will be at risk if marine species management policies are not structured to anticipate these range shifts. The 2017 mass mortality event of the North Atlantic right whale showcases the detrimental impact of unanticipated climate-mediated behavior in a species protected by geographically and seasonally fixed policies. Based on the results of a demographic capture-recapture model, right whales may face extinction in fewer than 30 years unless protective policies are expanded to cover their shifting distribution. Increased support of long-term monitoring programs paired with environmental modeling research is critical to developing more proactive conservation management strategies and preventing further ecological crises.}

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus marinus is abundant and widespread throughout the world's oceans and always co-occurs geographically with the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus. In the Atlantic Ocean, these 2 picoplankters exhibit different spatial and seasonal distributions. In order to better understand the ecology of these species, we measured growth and photoacclimation responses including fluorescence excitation [F*ph({$\lambda$})] and in vivo absorption [a*ph({$\lambda$})] spectra over a range of growth irradiances for P. marinus (clone SS120) and Synechococcus WH8103, both isolated from the Sargasso Sea. To explore the physiological diversity of P. marinus, we measured the physiological responses of another P. marinus clone, MED4, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. Growth rate as a function of temperature was also examined for all 3 clones. P. marinus SS120 and Synechococcus WH8103 have different temperature optima for growth, but these do not explain the different latitudinal distributions in the North Atlantic. P. marinus SSI20 is adapted for growth at low light intensities relative to Synechococcus WH8103, which is consistent with the relative depth distribution of P. marinus and Synechococcus in the field. The light-dependent growth response of P. marinus MED4 is more similar to Synechococcus WH8103 than to P. marinus SS120. The unique pigment content of P. marinus (which contain divinyl chlorophylls a and b) results in maximal absorbance in the blue wavelengths. The high total chl b/chl a ratio of P. marinus SS120 enables it to absorb more light, grow faster than Synechococcus WH8103 (and P. marinus MED4) at low light intensities, and presumably to outcompete Synechococcus in the deep euphotic zone. At high growth irradiances, P. marinus SS120 contains measureable amounts of normal (monovinyl) chl b, whereas this pigment was not found in P. marinus MED4 at any growth irradiance. Photoacclimative changes in pigment ratios, and not package effect, account for most of the changes in a*ph({$\lambda$}) and F*ph({$\lambda$}) with light intensity for all 3 picoplankters. At high light intensities, zeaxanthin contributes substantially to a*ph({$\lambda$}) in the blue, but appears to transfer little or no excitation energy to the reaction centers, based on F*ph({$\lambda$}) measurements. For P. marinus, high absorption in the blue due to divinyl chl a and b relative to normal chl a and b, absorption due to zeaxanthin, and small cell size result in unusually high a*ph (blue) relative to a*ph (red).},

Moreover, analyses of field populations in the North Atlantic have shown that distinct ecotypes can coexist in the same water column. These and other observations have led to the hypothesis that Prochlorococcus is comprised of genetically distinct ecotypes that collectively expand the range of light intensities over which the genus can thrive. In this paper, we explore this hypothesis by comparing the photophysiology of 10 different Prochlorococcus isolates from diverse oceanographic regimes. We found that the 10 isolates could be grouped into two loose clusters based on their growth response to varying light intensity and their chlorophyll b/a2 (Chl b/a2) ratios. Although both groups photoacclimate when grown over a range of light intensities, isolates with distinctly higher Chl b/a2 ratios (high B/A ecotype) reach maximal growth rates at lower irradiances (Ik,g), have high growth efficiencies ({$\alpha$}g), and are inhibited in growth at irradiances where isolates with low Chl b/a2 ratios (low B/A ecotype) are growing maximally. High Chl b/a2 ratios resulted in higher spectrally weighted average Chl a2-specific absorption coefficient ({\=a}chl*), Chl a2 specific light-harvesting efficiency ({$\alpha$}chla), and quantum yield ({$\varphi$}m) under low growth irradiances for the isolates of the high B/A ecotype relative to the others. The distinction between the high and low B/A ecotypes is supported by molecular phylogenies constructed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene.

Additions of N alone resulted in 1.5-2 fold increases in primary productivity and chlorophyll after 48 h, with larger ( threefold) increases observed for the addition of P in combination with N (NP). Measurements of cellular chlorophyll contents permitted evaluation of the physiological response of the photosynthetic apparatus to N and P additions in three picophytoplankton groups. In both Prochlorococcus and the picoeukaryotes, cellular chlorophyll increased by similar amounts in N and NP treatments relative to all other treatments, suggesting that pigment synthesis was N limited. In contrast, the increase of cellular chlorophyll was greater in NP than in N treatments in Synechococcus, suggestive of NP co-limitation. Relative increases in cellular nucleic acid were also only observed in Synechococcus for NP treatments, indicating co-limitation of net nucleic acid synthesis. A lack of response to relief of nutrient stress for the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry, Fv :Fm, suggests that the low nutrient supply to this region resulted in a condition of balanced nutrient limited growth, rather than starvation. N thus appears to be the proximal (i.e. direct physiological) limiting nutrient in the oligotrophic sub-tropical North Atlantic. In addition, some major picophytoplankton groups, as well as overall autotrophic community biomass, appears to be co-limited by N and P.},

Physiologically and genetically distinct Prochlorococcus ecotypes partition the water column: high-B/A (low-light adapted) ecotypes are generally restricted to the deep euphotic zone near or at the nitracline. Low-B/A (high-light adapted) ecotypes predominate in, but are not limited to, NO3--depleted surface waters, where they outnumber coexisting Synechococcus populations. The niche partitioning by different Prochlorococcus ecotypes begs the question of whether they also differ in their nitrogen (N) utilization physiology, especially with respect to NO3- utilization. To explore this possibility, we studied the capabilities of different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains to grow on a variety of N sources. We found that all the isolates grew well on NH4+ and all were capable of urea utilization, occasionally at a lower growth rate. None of the Prochlorococcus isolates were able to grow with NO3-. Four high-B/A Prochlorococcus isolates grew on NO3-, but all others did not. Whole genome analysis of the low-B/A Prochlorococcus MED4 revealed that the genes required for NO uptake and reduction were absent. The genome of the high-B/A Prochlorococcus MIT 9313 also lacked the NO3- utilization genes but has homologs of genes required for NO3- utilization consistent with its physiology and ecology. Thus, the utilization of different N sources in the marine environment is partitioned among closely related ecotypes, each with adaptations optimized for the environment where these sources are available.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({\textpm}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

  abstract = {The growth rate of a diatom (Chaetoceros protuberans) was followed during transfers from moderate to higher or lower irradiances (PAR) with differing spectral compositions (``white,'' ``blue,'' and ``green'' light). Chlorophyll-specific and carbon-specific absorption coefficients of the algae were monitored, allowing changes in the quantum yield for growth ({$\Phi$}{\textmu}) to be assessed. All the parameters appear to be practically unaffected by chromatic conditions, provided that the photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR) is made equal. Diatoms respond to the energy level whatever the color. Nevertheless, due to opposite influences of the modifications in the ``package'' effect and in the C : Chl a ratio ({$\Theta$}), the light-harvesting capabilities of the living carbon pool vary only weakly. Therefore the growth rate change (from 0.3 to 1.2 d-1) is essentially governed by the change in {$\Phi$}{\textmu} (from 0.01 to 0.052 mol C retained mol-1 quanta absorbed). The kinetics of the Chl-a-per-cell modification and of the {$\Phi$}{\textmu} response is rather fast (within approximately one generation). Quantum yield for growth is halved after a transfer to high irradiance; thereafter it remains low and steady. Conversely the enhanced value observed just after transfer to low irradiance is not maintained beyond 2 or 3 d; after that, {$\Phi$}{\textmu} is restored practically to its initial value.},

  abstract = {Recent studies by Morel (1978) and Platt, Sathyendranath, Caverhill and Lewis (1988) have demonstrated the relative stability of the relationship between available photosynthetic energy at the ocean surface and energy stored by algal photosynthesis, once it has been normalized with respect to the column integrated chlorophyll biomass. Therefore the cross section via a vis photosynthesis and per unit of areal chlorophyll, {$\psi\ast$}, in m2 (g Chl)-1, should be relatively stable in spite of the various environmental and trophic situations possibly encountered in the open ocean. Such an ecological or biogeochemical ``constant'' is of importance when trying to transform biomass maps (obtained from remotely sensed ocean colour data) into primary production maps. Its approximate constancy has to be understood and deserves analysis. This analysis rests on the use of the local and instantaneous growth rate equation (Kiefer and Mitchell, 1983) which has to be triply integrated with respect to wavelength, depth and time. Such an integration is, in effect, the core of a light production model which schematically includes the following steps: 1.(i) to compute as a function of the sun elevation for various days, latitudes and atmospheric conditions (aerosols, water vapour, etc.) the photosynthetic energy impinging at the ocean surface (direct and diffuse components);2.(ii) to account for the loss by reflection at the air-sea interface;3.(iii) to propagate this radiant energy (in terms of spectral scalar irradiance) throughout the water column and according to given pigment vertical profiles;4.(iv) to evaluate what part of energy is absorbed by algae within the productive column;5.(v) and finally to compute that part of absorbed energy which is stored in the form of organic carbon added to the initial biomass; this last step implies that the yield for growth be modelled as a function of the irradiance level and temperature. Sensitivity tests have been effected with respect not only to the physical parameters which can be accurately modelled, but also with respect to the physiological factors for which values and parameterisation are more uncertain. Non-linear and interactive influences cause the {$\psi\ast$} values obtained by running the model, to vary within a rather restricted range (within a factor 2, for most of the trophic and environmental conditions), which are similar to those resulting from field studies. The variability of the biomass-normalized primary production can be explained and the seasonal or zonal trends illustrated. The effect of cloudiness is also analysed. This spectral light --- photosynthesis model (a sub model in the more general study of the biomass evolution) can be used either to reproduce primary production experiments and also as a predictive tool in the oceanic carbon fixation problem. The global scale made accessible by satellite techniques requires that a climatological field of the {$\psi\ast$} parameter be produced. This can be done by operating the present model, provided that the physiological factors which intervene are sufficiently ascertained and adequately parameterised, and also provided that the vertical distibution of the algal biomass can be inferred from the partial information (restricted to the upper layer) delivered by ocean colour sensors.},

  abstract = {Three unialgal strains of Prochlorococcus and four of Synechococcus were grown in batch culture at low irradiances. The spectral values of light absorption, scattering and backscattering of intact cells in suspension were determined, together with cell counts, size distribution and pigment composition (via HPLC). The spectral efficiency factors Qa, Qb, Qbb for light absorption, scattering and backscattering respectively, were derived, as well as the corresponding chlorophyll-specific coefficients a*, b* and bb*. The pigment used when normalizing is ``true'' chlorophyll a for Synechococcus, and divinyl-chlorophyll a for Prochlorococcus. In correspondence with small sizes (0.6 {$\mu$}m, on average) Prochlorococcus exhibits Qb values below those of Synechococcus (size about 0.9 {$\mu$}m, on average). In contrast, Qa is higher for Prochlorococcus than for Synechococcus, in response to high internal divinyl-chlorophyll content. In the blue part of the spectrum the probability for photons of being absorbed by a Prochlorococcus cell exceeds that of being scattered. Such a combination has never been found before for other algal cells, consistently more efficient as scatterers than as absorbers. The magnitude of the three efficiency Q-factors, as well as their spectral variations, can be understood and reconstructed in the frame of the Mie theory. The impact of these small organisms, dominant in oligotrophic environment, upon the optical properties of such waters are discussed on the basis of their chlorophyll-specific optical coefficients. Their absorption capabilities (per unit of chlorophyll) are not far from being maximum, to the extent that the package effect is rather reduced. With respect to scattering, Prochlorococcus cells have a minute signature compared to that of Synechococcus. This point is illustrated using vertical profiles of fluorescence, attenuation coefficient, cell number, Chl a and divinyl-Chl a concentrations, as observed in an oligotrophic tropical situation. Even if the backscattering-to-scattering ratio is, as theoretically expected, higher for Prochlorococcus than for all other algae (including Synechococcus), their light backscattering capacity definitely remains negligible.},

  abstract = {The phytoplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean is numerically dominated by the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, accounting for approximately half of all photosynthesis. In the illuminated euphotic zone where Prochlorococcus grows, reactive oxygen species are continuously generated via photochemical reactions with dissolved organic matter. However, Prochlorococcus genomes lack catalase and additional protective mechanisms common in other aerobes, and this genus is highly susceptible to oxidative damage from hydrogen peroxide (HOOH). In this study we showed that the extant microbial community plays a vital, previously unrecognized role in cross-protecting Prochlorococcus from oxidative damage in the surface mixed layer of the oligotrophic ocean. Microbes are the primary HOOH sink in marine systems, and in the absence of the microbial community, surface waters in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean accumulated HOOH to concentrations that were lethal for Prochlorococcus cultures. In laboratory experiments with the marine heterotroph Alteromonas sp., serving as a proxy for the natural community of HOOH-degrading microbes, bacterial depletion of HOOH from the extracellular milieu prevented oxidative damage to the cell envelope and photosystems of co-cultured Prochlorococcus, and facilitated the growth of Prochlorococcus at ecologically-relevant cell concentrations. Curiously, the more recently evolved lineages of Prochlorococcus that exploit the surface mixed layer niche were also the most sensitive to HOOH. The genomic streamlining of these evolved lineages during adaptation to the high-light exposed upper euphotic zone thus appears to be coincident with an acquired dependency on the extant HOOH-consuming community. These results underscore the importance of (indirect) biotic interactions in establishing niche boundaries, and highlight the impacts that community-level responses to stress may have in the ecological and evolutionary outcomes for co-existing species.},

Prochlorococcus grows robustly at low cell concentrations, in liquid or on solid medium, when cocultured with marine heterotrophic bacteria. Once the Prochlorococcus cell concentration surpasses a critical threshold, the ``helper'' heterotrophs can be eliminated with antibiotics to produce axenic cultures.

  abstract = {The marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus numerically dominate open ocean phytoplankton. Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to photoinactivation of Photosystem II under a range of light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid photoinactivation than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this photoinactivation. We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of photoinactivation on the basis of photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of photoinactivation of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline photoinactivation across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct photoinactivation of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and photoinactivation as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These differential cost-benefits probably underlie the distinct photoacclimation strategies of the species.},

If the extremely effective photosynthetic energy conversion could be efficiently combined with a biological process of hydrogen production, it will represent a significant step toward this goal. The best candidate to do the job is photosystem I (PSI) of oxygenic photosynthesis. Despite its enormous complexity, the plant PSI is arguably the most efficient nano-photochemical machine in Nature. It emerged as a homodimeric structure containing several chlorophyll molecules over 3.5 billion years ago, and has perfected its photoelectric properties ever since. The recently determined structure of plant PSI, which is at the top of the evolutionary tree of this kind of complexes, provided the first relatively high-resolution structural model of the supercomplex containing a reaction center (RC) and a peripheral antenna (LHCI) complexes. The structure should provide a template for designing artificial systems amenable for utilizable energy production.},

PSI generates the most negative redox potential in nature and largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. PSII generates an oxidant whose redox potential is high enough to enable it to oxidize H2O, a substrate so abundant that it assures a practically unlimited electron source for life on earth. During the last century, the sophisticated techniques of spectroscopy, molecular genetics, and biochemistry were used to reveal the structure and function of the two photosystems. The new structures of PSI and PSII from cyanobacteria, algae, and plants has shed light not only on the architecture and mechanism of action of these intricate membrane complexes, but also on the evolutionary forces that shaped oxygenic photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is the light-driven water:plastoquinone oxidoreductase of oxygenic photosynthesis and is found in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. Considerable attention is focused on how PSII is assembled in vivo and how it is repaired following irreversible damage by visible light (so-called photoinhibition). Understanding these processes might lead to the development of plants with improved growth characteristics especially under conditions of abiotic stress.Here we summarize recent results on the assembly and repair of PSII in cyanobacteria, which are excellent model organisms to study higher plant photosynthesis.Assembly of PSII is highly co-ordinated and proceeds through a number of distinct assembly intermediates. Associated with these assembly complexes are proteins that are not found in the final functional PSII complex. Structural information and possible functions are beginning to emerge for several of these `assembly' factors, notably Ycf48/Hcf136, Psb27 and Psb28. A number of other auxiliary proteins have been identified that appear to have evolved since the divergence of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The repair of PSII involves partial disassembly of the damaged complex, the selective replacement of the damaged sub-unit (predominantly the D1 sub-unit) by a newly synthesized copy, and reassembly. It is likely that chlorophyll released during the repair process is temporarily stored by small CAB-like proteins (SCPs). A model is proposed in which damaged D1 is removed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of two different types of FtsH sub-unit (FtsH2 and FtsH3), with degradation proceeding from the N-terminus of D1 in a highly processive reaction. It is postulated that a similar mechanism of D1 degradation also operates in chloroplasts. Deg proteases are not required for D1 degradation in Synechocystis 6803 but members of this protease family might play a supplementary role in D1 degradation in chloroplasts under extreme conditions.},

Further south, the prochlorophytes formed subsurface maxima; the median depth of prochlorophyte (but not Synechococcus) populations followedthe deepening of the nitracline. Prochlorophytes were not present in waters north of the Gulf Stream in May, although we had observed them there on a previous September cruise. They were present year round near Bermuda, with lowest concentrations in the winter, when Synechococcus was most numerous; the prochorophytes appear to "bloom" later than the Synechococcus, after the onset of seasonal stratification.

  abstract = {Marine phytoplankton produce and scavenge Reactive Oxygen Species, to support cellular processes, while limiting damaging reactions. Some prokaryotic picophytoplankton have, however, lost all genes encoding scavenging of hydrogen peroxide. Such losses of metabolic function can only apply to Reactive Oxygen Species which potentially traverse the cell membrane outwards, before provoking damaging intracellular reactions. We hypothesized that cell radius influences which elements of Reactive Oxygen Species metabolism are partially or fully dispensable from a cell. We therefore investigated genomes and transcriptomes from diverse marine eukaryotic phytoplankton, ranging from 0.4 to 44 {$\mu$}m radius, to analyze the genomic allocations encoding enzymes metabolizing Reactive Oxygen Species. Superoxide has high reactivity, short lifetimes and limited membrane permeability. Genes encoding superoxide scavenging are ubiquitous across phytoplankton, but the fractional gene allocation decreased with increasing cell radius, consistent with a nearly fixed set of core genes for scavenging superoxide pools. Hydrogen peroxide has lower reactivity, longer intracellular and extracellular lifetimes and readily crosses cell membranes. Genomic allocations to both hydrogen peroxide production and scavenging decrease with increasing cell radius. Nitric Oxide has low reactivity, long intracellular and extracellular lifetimes and readily crosses cell membranes. Neither Nitric Oxide production nor scavenging genomic allocations changed with increasing cell radius. Many taxa, however, lack the genomic capacity for nitric oxide production or scavenging. The probability of presence of capacity to produce nitric oxide decreases with increasing cell size, and is influenced by flagella and colony formation. In contrast, the probability of presence of capacity to scavenge nitric oxide increases with increasing cell size, and is again influenced by flagella and colony formation.},

  abstract = {The extrinsic PsbU and PsbV proteins are known to play a critical role in stabilizing the M\- n4CaO5 cluster of the PSII oxygenevolving complex (OEC). However, most isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus naturally miss these proteins, even though they have kept the main OEC protein, PsbO. A structural homology model of the PSII of such a natural deletion mutant strain (P. marinus MED4) did not reveal any obvious compensation mechanism for this lack. To assess the physiological consequences of this unusual OEC, we compared oxygen evolution between Prochlorococcus strains missing psbU and psbV (PCC 9511 and SS120) and two marine strains possessing these genes (Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus sp. WH7803). While the low light-adapted strain SS120 exhibited the lowest maximal \-O2 evolution rates \-(Pmax per divinyl-chlorophyll a, per cell or per photosystem II) of all four strains, the high light-adapted strain PCC 9511 displayed even higher \-PChlmax and P\- PSIImax at high irradiance than Synechococcus sp.

For the MED4 strain, which has a high divinyl-chlorophyll a to divinyl-chlorophyll b (DV-Chl a/b) ratio ranging from 11.4 to 15.0 (w/w), the major antenna proteins had an apparent molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. In contrast for the SS120 strain, which has a low DV-Chl a/b ratio ranging from 1.1 to 2.2, antenna apoproteins were observed in the range 34--38 kDa. For both strains, these apoproteins decreased at high growth irradiance but more markedly in the latter. Partially purified antenna fractions had a DV-Chl a/b ratio ca. 7-fold lower for SS120 than for MED4 at 30 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. For both strains, the 77 K fluorescence emission spectra of whole thylakoids displayed a major peak at 685 nm and a broad but very low shoulder above 700 nm. Energetic coupling of the antenna to both PS II and PSI reaction centers was demonstrated for SS120 by the strong contribution of DV-Chl b in both the 77 K excitation fluorescence spectra and the oxidized minus reduced absorption difference spectra of P700. The PS I to PS II ratio of Prochlorococcus SS120 was determined as being 0.7 {\textpm} 0.1 at low light.},

All three strains contained divinyl (DV) chlorophylls (Chl) a and b, both distinguishable from "normal" Chls by their red-shifted blue absorption maximum, a Chl c-like pigment at low concentration, zeaxanthin, and [alpha]-carotene. The presence of two phaeophytin b peaks in acidified extracts from both Atlantic strains grown at high lg suggests that these strains also had a normal Chl b-like pigment. In these strains, the total Chl b to DV-Chl a molar ratio decreased from about 1 at 7.5 [mu]mol quanta m-2 s-1 to 0.4 to 0.5 at 133 [mu]mol quanta m-2 s-1. In contrast, the MED strain always had a low DV-Chl b to DV-Chl a molar ratio, ranging between 0.13 at low lg and 0.08 at high lg. The discrepancies between the Atlantic and MED strains could result from differences either in the number of light-harvesting complexes (LHC) II per photosystem II or in the Chl b-binding capacity of the apoproteins constituting LHC II. Photosynthesis was saturated at approximately 5 fg C(fg Chl)-1 h-1 or 6 fg C cell-1 h-1, and growth was saturated at approximately 0.45 d-1 for both MED and SARG strains at 18[deg]C, but saturating irradiances differed between strains. Atlantic strains exhibited increased light-saturated rates and quantum yield for carbon fixation under blue light.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is the key phytoplanktonic organism of tropical gyres, large ocean regions that are depleted of the essential macronutrients needed for photosynthesis and cell growth. This cyanobacterium has adapted itself to oligotrophy by minimizing the resources necessary for life through a drastic reduction of cell and genome sizes. This rarely observed strategy in freeliving organisms has conferred on Prochlorococcus a considerable advantage over other phototrophs, including its closest relative Synechococcus, for life in this vast yet little variable ecosystem. However, this strategy seems to reach its limits in the upper layer of the S Pacific gyre, the most oligotrophic region of the world ocean. By losing some important genes and/or functions during evolution, Prochlorococcus has seemingly become dependent on co-occurring microorganisms. In this review, we present some of the recent advances in the ecology, biology, and evolution of Prochlorococcus, which because of its ecological importance and tiny genome is rapidly imposing itself as a model organism in environmental microbiology.},

It is also used to mark the level of oxygen in the early atmosphere of the Earth that is believed to have led to major evolutionary changes. It is named after Louis Pasteur, the French microbiologist who studied anaerobic microbial fermentation, and is related to the Pasteur effect.It was once supposed that about 400 million years ago, in the Cambrian period, the level of oxygen in the atmosphere rose from 0.1 to 1 percent of present atmospheric level. Supposedly, this led to many organisms adapting from fermentation to respiration, leading to organisms evolving photosynthesis and what is termed the Cambrian explosion of species. It has also been suggested that this increased oxygen level reduced the influence of ultraviolet radiation.It is now well documented that oxygen level reached at least 10\% of the present value 2.4 billion years ago (for details see Great Oxygenation Event).},

  abstract = {Organisms use various adaptive strategies against phosphate stress, including lipid remodeling. Here, the response of major membrane lipids to phosphate stress was analyzed in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Unlike plants and eukaryotic microalgae, no significant increases in neutral lipids were found, whereas glycolipids content increased to as high as 6.13\% (of dry cell weight, DCW) and phospholipids decreased to 0.34\% (of DCW) after 16\,days of cultivation without phosphate. Glycolipids accumulation were mainly attributed to the significant increase of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) by 50\% and sulfoquinovosyldiaclglycerol (SQDG) by 90\%, both of which acted as complementary lipids for phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the cyanobacterial membrane. Also, a notable increase in content (by 48\%) of C18 fatty acids (especially C18:1) was observed in all glycolipids at the expense of C12 and C14 (72\%). These changes may contribute to membrane fluidity and photosynthetic activity for basic cell metabolism and phosphate stress adaptation. Lipidomic analyses showed the reduction of PG 18:1/16: 0 (by 52\%) with the increase of DGDG 18:1/16:0 (133\%) and SQDG 18:1/16:0 (245\%), strongly suggesting a direct conversion of PG to DGDG and SQDG. Moreover, the decreasing amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) 16:1/16:0 (22\%) was consistent with the increase of free fatty acids (125\%) on day 2 of phosphate absence, which suggested that MGDG is more likely to provide a pool of fatty acids for de novo synthesis of glycolipids. This study provides valuable insight into cyanobacteria adaptation strategies to phosphate stress by membrane lipid remodeling and unveils the underlying acyl chain fluxes into glycolipids.},

Knowing why oxygen became plentiful could illuminate the evolution of our planet's flora and fauna, but scientists have struggled to find an explanation satisfying to all. Now, a research team has proposed a novel link between how fast our planet spun on its axis---which defines the length of a day---and the ancient production of additional oxygen. Their modeling of Earth's early days, which incorporates evidence from microbial mats coating the bottom of a shallow, sunlit sinkhole in Lake Huron, produced a surprising conclusion: As Earth's spin slowed and led to longer days, that could have triggered more photosynthesis from similar mats, allowing oxygen to build up in ancient seas and diffuse up into the atmosphere. Extra light spurred oxygen release by mats of photosynthetic bacteria, models and sinkhole data suggest.

Two types of morphologically more or less separate membrane systems occur in cyanobacteria, the chlorophyll-containing intracytoplasmic or thylakoid membranes (ICM, ``photosynthetic lamellae'') and the chlorophyll-free cytoplasmic or plasma membranes (CM). Both ICM and CM partly contain identical electron transport components forming a dual function photosynthetic-respiratory assembly in ICM but, as necessitated by the absence of chlorophyll, a purely respiratory chain in CM. Both ICM and CM surround individual and osmotically autonomous cellular compartments, viz. the intrathylakoid space and the cytosolic space, respectively. (The periplasmic space, characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria and sandwiched together with other cell wall constituents such as peptidoglycan between CM and the outer membrane, is in osmotic equilibrium with the external medium of the cell and, therefore, is not counted as intracellular compartment.).},

In this review, we discuss the extent of high-pressure habitats in early and modern times and provide a short overview of microbial survival under dynamic pressures. We summarize the current knowledge about the impact of microbial activity on biogeochemical cycles under pressures characteristic of the deep subsurface. We evaluate the possibility that pressure can be a limiting parameter for life at depth.

  abstract = {To find the solution to problems in applied marine optics, we do not always need to compute the submarine irradiance at all depths; in many cases, it is sufficient to know the average attenuation of light for finite layers of arbitrary thickness. If multiple scattering can be neglected, the average attenuation of light in a finite layer of the water column depends only on the vertical distribution of the attenuating substances; in open-ocean waters, the most important of these is phytoplankton. It is shown how the average attenuation of monochromatic light in an arbitrary layer can be determined when the vertical pigment profile takes one of two standardized forms: a shifted Gaussian or a triangle. The choice of efficient algorithms to compute the attenuation in a layer using these models is discussed. The extension to polychromatic light involves the selection of a function to represent the spectral distribution of the specific absorption coefficient for phytoplankton, as determined by observation. Chebyshev polynomial representation is shown to be convenient for applications which require the calculation of a weighted wavelength integral. An efficient procedure for the evaluation of these integrals, Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature, is presented and evaluated. The extension to the computation of bulk properties for discrete layers is straightforward.},

It is suggested that one way to develop a database that serves to sort and predict phytoplankton variability over the day may be to encourage the creation of a `temporal library'.

When grown in obligate diazotrophy, cells face the double burden of a more ATP-demanding N-acquisition mode and additional metabolic losses imposed by the transient storage of reducing potential as carbohydrate, compared to a hypothetical N               2               assimilation directly driven by photosynthetic electron transport. Further, this energetic burden imposed by N               2               -fixation could not be alleviated, despite the high irradiance level within the cultures, because photosynthesis was limited by the availability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and possibly by a constrained capacity for carbon storage. DIC limitation exacerbates the costs on growth imposed by nitrogen fixation. Therefore, the competitive efficiency of diazotrophs could be hindered in areas with insufficient renewal of dissolved gases and/or with intense phytoplankton biomass that both decrease available light energy and draw the DIC level down.}

Model simulations were compared with a 14-year time series of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cell abundances at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Data were analysed to examine spatial and temporal patterns in abundances and their ranges of variability in the euphotic zone, the surface mixed layer and the layer in the euphotic zone but below the base of the mixed layer. Model simulations show that the apparent occupation of the whole euphotic zone by a genus can be the result of a co-occurrence of different ecotypes that segregate vertically. The segregation of ecotypes can result simply from differences in light response. A sensitivity analysis of the model, performed on the parameter {$\alpha$} (initial slope of the light-response curve) and the DIN concentration in the upper water column, demonstrates that the model successfully reproduces the observed range of vertical distributions. Results support the idea that intermittent mixing events may have important ecological and geochemical impacts on the phytoplankton community at Station ALOHA.},

Three culture experiments were carried out to investigate the changes in \&delta;13C of the diatom Thalassiosira rotula during growth in an artificially modified medium (ASW). Three different dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations were tested to verify if carbon availability affects phytoplankton \&delta;13C. Simultaneously, at each experiment, T. rotula was cultured under natural DIC isotopic composition (\&delta;13CDIC) and carbonate system conditions. The available DIC pool for diatoms grown in ASW was characterised by \&delta;13CDIC values (\&minus;44.2 \&plusmn; 0.9\&permil;) significantly lower than the typical marine range. Through photosynthetic DIC uptake, microalgae \&delta;13C rapidly changed, reaching significantly low values (until \&minus;43.4\&permil;). Moreover, the different DIC concentrations did not affect the diatom \&delta;13C, exhibiting the same trend in \&delta;13C values in the three ASW experiments. The experiments prove that phytoplankton isotopic composition quickly responds to changes in the \&delta;13C of the medium, making this approach a promising and low-impact tool for detecting CO2(g) submarine leakages from CO2(g) deposits.},

The largest differences were found in two sulfur-containing lipids, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and phosphatidylsulfocholine caused probably by the remodeling of lipid species. These diatoms have been found to use several mechanisms to resolve growth in extreme environments, i.e. silica starvation. The presence of insoluble nano-SiO2 leads to the replacement of cellular phospholipids with sulfolipids. Regioisomer ratios also vary depending on the concentration of nanoSiO2 in the culture medium, i.e. the biosynthesis of polar lipids via the prokaryotic (plastidial) and/or eukaryotic (explastidial) pathways. Complex analyses of polar lipids using high resolution HILIC-LC/ESI-tandem, as used for diatoms, can also be used for other photosynthetic microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Theoretical studies predict that competition for limited resources reduces biodiversity to the point of ecological instability, whereas strong predator/prey interactions enhance the number of coexisting species and limit fluctuations in abundances. In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring {$\sim$}6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

  abstract = {Carbon fixation by phytoplankton near the surface and the sinking of this particulate material to deeper waters are key components of the biological carbon pump. The efficiency of the biological pump is influenced by the size and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community. Large, heavily ballasted taxa such as diatoms sink quickly and thus efficiently remove fixed carbon from the upper ocean. Smaller, nonballasted species such as picoplanktonic cyanobacteria are usually thought to contribute little to export production. Research in the past decade, however, has shed new light on the potential importance of small phytoplankton to carbon export, especially in oligotrophic oceans, where small cells dominate primary productivity. Here, I examine the mechanisms and pathways through which small-phytoplankton carbon is exported from the surface ocean and the role of small phytoplankton in food webs of a variety of ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic O2 production can be an important source of oxygen in sub-surface ocean waters especially in permanently stratified oligotrophic regions of the ocean where O2 produced in deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) is not likely to be outgassed. Today, permanently stratified regions extend across approximately 40\% of the global ocean and their extent is expected to increase in a warmer ocean. Thus, predicting future ocean oxygen conditions requires a better understanding of the potential response of photosynthetic oxygen production to a warmer ocean. Based on our own and published observations of water column processes in oligotrophic regions, we develop a one-dimensional water column model describing photosynthetic oxygen production in the Sargasso Sea to quantify the importance of photosynthesis for the downward flux of O2 and examine how it may be influenced in a warmer ocean. Photosynthesis is driven in the model by vertical mixing of nutrients (including eddy-induced mixing) and diazotrophy and is found to substantially increase the downward O2 flux relative to physical--chemical processes alone. Warming (2{$^\circ$}C) surface waters does not significantly change oxygen production at the DCM. Nor does a 15\% increase in re-mineralization rate (assuming Q10\,=\,2; 2{$^\circ$}C warming) have significant effect on net sub-surface oxygen accumulation. However, changes in the relative production of particulate (POM) and dissolved organic material (DOM) generate relatively large changes in net sub-surface oxygen production. As POM/DOM production is a function of plankton community composition, this implies plankton biodiversity and food web structure may be important factors influencing O2 production in a warmer ocean. This article is part of the themed issue `Ocean ventilation and deoxygenation in a warming world'.},

The presence of phaeophytin (Ph) a not only interferes with estimates of Chl a but also with Chl b and c determinations. The universal algorithms can hence be misleading if used on natural collections containing large amounts of Ph. The methanol algorithms are severely affected by the presence of Ph and so are not recommended. The algorithms were tested on representative mixtures of Chls prepared from extracts of algae with known Chl composition. The limits of detection (and inherent error, {\textpm}95 \% confidence limit) for all the Chl equations were less than 0.03 g m--3. The algorithms are both accurate and precise for Chl a and d but less accurate for Chl b and c. With caution the algorithms can be used to calculate a Chl profile of natural assemblages of algae. The relative error of measurements of Chls increases hyperbolically in diluted extracts. For safety reasons, efficient extraction of Chls and the convenience of being able to use polystyrene cuvettes, the algorithms for ethanol are recommended for routine assays of Chls in natural assemblages of aquatic plants.},

It numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans2,3, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. Here we compare the genomes of two Prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the Prochlorococcus lineage4 and that have different minimum, maximum and optimal light intensities for growth5. The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

Our results highlight the power of microbial interactions to drive major biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and elsewhere with consequences at the global scale.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Many microorganisms produce resting cells with very low metabolic activity that allow them to survive phases of prolonged nutrient or energy stress. In cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic phytoplankton, the production of resting stages is accompanied by a loss of photosynthetic pigments, a process termed chlorosis. Here, we show that a chlorosis-like process occurs under multiple stress conditions in axenic laboratory cultures of               Prochlorococcus               , the dominant phytoplankton linage in large regions of the oligotrophic ocean and a global key player in ocean biogeochemical cycles. In               Prochlorococcus               strain MIT9313, chlorotic cells show reduced metabolic activity, measured as C and N uptake by Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). However, unlike many other cyanobacteria, chlorotic               Prochlorococcus               cells are not viable and do not regrow under axenic conditions when transferred to new media. Nevertheless, cocultures with a heterotrophic bacterium,               Alteromonas macleodii               HOT1A3, allowed               Prochlorococcus               to survive nutrient starvation for months. We propose that reliance on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, rather than the ability to survive extended starvation as resting cells, underlies the ecological success of               Prochlorococcus               .

Using METATRYP, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less.

  abstract = {Marine picocyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, substantially contribute to marine primary production and have been the subject of extensive ecological and genomic studies. Little is known about their close relatives from freshwater and non-marine environments. Phylogenomic analyses (using 136 proteins) provide strong support for the monophyly of a clade of non-marine picocyanobacteria consisting of Cyanobium, Synechococcus and marine Sub-cluster 5.2; this clade itself is sister to marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. The most basal lineage within the Syn/Pro clade, Sub-Cluster 5.3, includes marine and freshwater strains. Relaxed molecular clock (SSU, LSU) analyses show that while ancestors of the Syn/Pro clade date as far back as the end of the Pre-Cambrian, modern crown groups evolved during the Carboniferous and Triassic. Comparative genomic analyses reveal novel gene cluster arrangements involved in phycobilisome (PBS) metabolism in freshwater strains. Whilst PBS genes in marine Synechococcus are mostly found in one type of phycoerythrin (PE) rich gene cluster (Type III), strains from non-marine habitats, so far, appear to be more diverse both in terms of pigment content and gene arrangement, likely reflecting a wider range of habitats. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the PE genes (mpeBA) evolved via a duplication of the cpeBA genes in an ancestor of the marine and non-marine picocyanobacteria and of the symbiotic strains Synechococcus spongiarum. A `primitive' Type III-like ancestor containing cpeBA and mpeBA had thus evolved prior to the divergence of the Syn/Pro clade and S. spongiarum. During the diversification of Synechococcus lineages, losses of mpeBA genes may explain the emergence of pigment cluster Types I, II, IIB, and III in both marine and non-marine habitats, with few lateral gene transfer events in specific taxa.},

The putative AtPPOX is 530 amino acid long and predicted to contain three distinct parts: a 64 amino acid long N-terminal putative chloroplast transit peptide, followed by a long Yjef\_N domain of unknown function and a C-terminal Pyridox\_oxidase domain. Recombinant proteins representing the C-terminal domain of AtPPOX and AtPPOX without transit peptide were expressed in E. coli and showed PPOX enzyme activity. The PDX3 knockout yeast deficient in PPOX activity exhibited sensitivity to oxidative stress. Constructs of AtPPOX cDNA of different lengths complemented the PDX3 knockout yeast for oxidative stress.

  abstract = {SummaryAccording to the endosymbiosis theory, cyanobacteria are assumed to be ancestors of chloroplasts. They are Gram-negative and perform oxygenic photosynthesis via two photosystems, which resemble the photosystems in the chloroplasts of eukaryotic plants. The membranes of cyanobacteria contain four main glycerolipids, three of which are glycolipids, namely, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and one of which is the phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The lipid composition of cyanobacterial membranes is similar to that of chloroplast membranes, and, in particular, to that of thylakoid membranes, and it is different from that of the membranes of most bacteria, which contain phospholipids as the major glyc-erolipids. The fatty acid composition of the membrane lipids of cyanobacteria differs among strains, and cyanobacteria can be classified into four groups in terms of their fatty acids. Among unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated to tetraunsaturated fatty acids have been found in cyanobacteria. In a limited number of cyanobacteria, the fatty acid composition resembles that of chloroplast membranes. The biosynthesis of membrane lipids in cyanobacteria has been studied in vivo by tracer experiments with radio-labeled compounds since the 1980s. However, the characterization and molecular identification of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipids had to await the cloning of the genes for these enzymes since most of these enzymes are membrane-bound and, thus, their solubilization and subsequent purification are relatively difficult. Genes for the desaturases of cyanobacteria, which introduce double bonds into fatty acids bound to membrane lipids, were cloned in the early 1990s, after identification of the desA gene that was able to complement a mutation that resulted in a defect in desaturation at the {$\Delta$}12 position. Many genes for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of various lipid classes were identified in the 2000s with the help of newly available databases of cyanobacterial genomic sequences. Many of the proteins encoded by the identified genes are homologous to their respective counterparts in chloro-plasts, supporting the endosymbiosis theory, but some of them are structurally distinct. This distinction suggests the possibility that original genes were replaced by unrelated genes during the evolution of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria. The biosynthesis of membrane lipids in cyanobacteria is regulated by environmental conditions, indicating that membrane lipids play an active role in adaptive processes. Studies of cyanobacterial lipids have shed light both on the evolution of chloroplasts and the adaptation of photosynthetic organisms to changes in environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG) is a vast and remote area where large uncertainties on variability in phytoplankton biomass and production remain due to the lack of biogeochemical in situ observations. In such oligotrophic environments, ecosystems are predominantly controlled by nutrients depletion in surface waters. However, this oligotrophic character can be disturbed in the vicinity of islands where enhancement of biological activity is known to occur (i.e. the island mass effect, IME). This study mainly focuses on in situ observations showing that an IME can be evidenced leeward of Tahiti (17.7{$^\circ$} S--149.5{$^\circ$} W), French Polynesia. Concomitant physical and biogeochemical observations collected with two Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats from April 2015 to November 2016 are used to investigate the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. The first float has a transit of more than 1000 km westward of Tahiti (open ocean conditions) while the second one remained in the Tahitian wake (around 45 km from the island coasts). In the oligotrophic central SPSG, the wintertime increase in upper layer chlorophyll a concentration is likely due to photoacclimation process. Vertical observations show a light-driven deepening of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) from winter to summer, consistently with previous descriptions. At the opposite, within the Tahitian wake, the DCM temporary widens during late spring in association with a biological enhancement in the upper layer. Combining in situ measurements with meteorological data along the Tahiti coasts, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model outputs and satellite-derived products (i.e., horizontal currents and associated fronts), the physical mechanisms involved in the disturbance of phytoplankton seasonal cycle in the Tahitian wake have been investigated. This disturbance results from the concomitant occurrence of strong precipitations and a zone of weak currents leeward Tahiti. We conjecture that the land drainage induces a significant supply of nitrate in the ocean upper layer (down to {\textasciitilde} 100 m) while a zone of weak currents in the southwestern zone behind Tahiti forms an accumulation zone, hence allowing phytoplankton growth up to 20 km away from the coastlines. Moreover, bio-optical measurements suggest that the composition of phytoplankton community could differ in the Tahitian wake vs. the open ocean area. Finally, in addition to extending information to the water column, only BGC-Argo floats could provide biogeochemical measurements in the SPSG region when clouds prevent the use of remote sensing.},

Prochlorococcus                 was isolated around 20 years ago and is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. The genus comprises specific ecotypes which are phylogenetically distinct and differ markedly in their photophysiology, allowing growth over a broad range of light and nutrient conditions within the 45{$^\circ$}N to 40{$^\circ$}S latitudinal belt that they occupy.

  abstract = {Background In spite of their abundance and importance, little is known about cyanobacterial cell biology and their cell cycle. During each cell cycle, chromosomes must be separated into future daughter cells, i.e. into both cell halves, which in many bacteria is achieved by an active machinery that operates during DNA replication. Many cyanobacteria contain multiple identical copies of the chromosome, but it is unknown how chromosomes are segregated into future daughter cells, and if an active or passive mechanism is operative. In addition to an outer and an inner cell membrane, cyanobacteria contain internal thylakoid membranes that carry the active photosynthetic machinery. It is unclear whether thylakoid membranes are invaginations of the inner cell membrane, or an independent membrane system. Results We have used different fluorescent dyes to study the organization of chromosomes and of cell and thylakoid membranes in live cyanobacterial cells. FM1-43 stained the outer and inner cytoplasmic membranes but did not enter the interior of the cell. In contrast, thylakoid membranes in unicellular Synechocystis cells became visible through a membrane-permeable stain only. Furthermore, continuous supply of the fluorescent dye FM1-43 resulted in the formation of one to four intracellular fluorescent structures in Synechocystis cells, within occurred within 30 to 60 minutes, and may represent membrane vesicles. Using fluorescent DNA stains, we found that Synechocystis genomic DNA is compacted in the cell centre that is devoid of thylakoid membranes. Nucleoids segregated very late in the cell cycle, just before complete closing of the division septum. In striking contrast to Bacillus subtilis, which possesses an active chromosome segregation machinery, fluorescence intensity of stained nucleoids differed considerably between the two Synechocystis daughter cells soon after cell division. Conclusion Our experiments strongly support the idea that the cytoplasmic and thylakoid membranes are not directly connected, but separate entities, in unicellular cyanobacteria. Our findings suggest that a transport system may exist between the cytoplasmic membrane and thylakoids, which could mediate the extension of thylakoid membranes and possibly also protein transport from the cytoplasmic membrane to thylakoid membranes. The cell cycle studies in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 show that the multiple chromosome copies per cell segregate very late in the cell cycle and in a much less stringent manner than in B. subtilis cells, indicating that chromosomes may become segregated randomly and in a passive fashion, possibly through constriction of the division septum.},

The core of this complex is composed of four subunits, cytochrome b, cytochrome f, subunit IV and the Rieske protein (PetC). In this study deletion mutants of all three petC genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were constructed to investigate their localization, involvement in electron transfer, respiration and photohydrogen evolution. Immunoblots revealed that PetC1, PetC2, and all other core subunits were exclusively localized in the thylakoids, while the third Rieske protein (PetC3) was the only subunit found in the cytoplasmic membrane. Deletion of petC3 and both of the quinol oxidases failed to elicit a change in respiration rate, when compared to the respective oxidase mutant. This supports a different function of PetC3 other than respiratory electron transfer. We conclude that the cytoplasmic membrane of Synechocystis lacks both a cytochrome c oxidase and the cytochrome b6f complex and present a model for the major electron transfer pathways in the two membranes of Synechocystis.

  abstract = {The societal importance of renewable carbon-based commodities and energy carriers has elicited a particular interest for high performance phototrophic microorganisms. Selection of optimal strains is often based on direct comparison under laboratory conditions of maximal growth rate or additional valued features such as lipid content. Instead of reporting growth rate in culture, estimation of photosynthetic efficiency (quantum yield of PSII) by pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorimetry is an often applied alternative method. Here we compared the quantum yield of PSII and the photonic yield on biomass for the green alga Chlorella sorokiniana 211-8K and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our data demonstrate that the PAM technique inherently underestimates the photosynthetic efficiency of cyanobacteria by rendering a high F0 and a low FM, specifically after the commonly practiced dark pre-incubation before a yield measurement. Yet when comparing the calculated biomass yield on light in continuous culture experiments, we obtained nearly equal values for both species. Using mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we analyzed the factors that compromise its PAM-based quantum yield measurements. We will discuss the role of dark respiratory activity, fluorescence emission from the phycobilisomes, and the Mehler-like reaction. Based on the above observations we recommend that PAM measurements in cyanobacteria are interpreted only qualitatively.},

The RubisCO genes (cbbL and cbbS) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme was purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the optimum pH and temperature, as well as Michaelis-Menton constants, were determined radiometrically. The degree to which this RubisCO discriminates against 13CO2 during fixation was determined by the high-precision substrate depletion method. Purified enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.5, was most active between 20{$^\circ$}C and 30{$^\circ$}C, had a moderate Vmax (0.41 {\textmu}mol min-1 mg protein-1), and had the highest {$K$}CO2 value (0.75 mmol L-1) for a form I RubisCO characterized to date. The  value,  = 1,000[({$K$}12/{$K$}13) - 1], for the enzyme was determined to be 24.0‰ (95\% C.I. = 22.2-25.6‰), within the range observed for other form I RubisCOs. This  value is a critical baseline for interpreting the {$\delta$}13C values of marine environmental samples, particularly those collected from the open ocean, where P. marinus is responsible for a substantial fraction of carbon fixation.},

  abstract = {Oxygenic photoautotrophs are, paradoxically, subject to photoinhibition of their photosynthetic apparatus, in particular one of its major components, the Photosystem II (PSII). Photoinhibition is generalized across species, light conditions and habitats, imposing substantial metabolic costs that lower photosynthetic productivity and constrain the niches of photoautotrophy. As a process driven by light reaching PSII, light attenuation in optically thick samples influences both the actual extent, and the detection, of photoinhibition. Chlorophyll fluorescence is widely used to measure photoinhibition, but fluorescence-based parameters are affected by light attenuation of both downwelling incident radiation traversing the sample to reach PSII, and emitted fluorescence upwelling through the sample. We used modelling, experimental manipulation of within-sample light attenuation, and meta-analysis of published data, to show substantial, differential effects of light attenuation and depth-integration of emitted fluorescence upon measurements of photoinhibition. Numerical simulations and experimental manipulation of light attenuation indicated that PSII photoinactivation tracked using chlorophyll fluorescence can appear to be over three times lower than the inherent cellular susceptibility to photoinactivation, in optically-dense samples such as leaves or biofilms. The meta-analysis of published data showed that this general trend was unknowingly present in the literature, revealing an overall difference of more than five times between optically thick leaves and optically thin cell suspensions. Although fluorescence-based parameters may provide ecophysiologically relevant information for characterizing the sample as a whole, light attenuation and depth integration can vary between samples independently of their intrinsic physiology. They should be used with caution when aiming to quantify in absolute terms inherent photoinhibition-related parameters in optically thick samples.},

  abstract = {This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism of an alternative electron flow (AEF) functioning under suppressed (CO2-limited) photosynthesis in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Photosynthetic linear electron flow, evaluated as the quantum yield of photosystem II [Y(II)], reaches a maximum shortly after the onset of actinic illumination. Thereafter, Y(II) transiently decreases concomitantly with a decrease in the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate and then recovers to a rate that is close to the initial maximum. These results show that CO2 limitation suppresses photosynthesis and induces AEF. In contrast to the wild type, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutants deficient in the genes encoding FLAVODIIRON2 (FLV2) and FLV4 proteins show no recovery of Y(II) after prolonged illumination. However, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutants deficient in genes encoding proteins functioning in photorespiration show AEF activity similar to the wild type. In contrast to Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 has no FLV proteins with high homology to FLV2 and FLV4 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This lack of FLV2/4 may explain why AEF is not induced under CO2-limited photosynthesis in S. elongatus PCC 7942. As the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli exhibits NADH-dependent oxygen reduction to water, we suggest that FLV2 and FLV4 mediate oxygen-dependent AEF in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 when electron acceptors such as CO2 are not available.},

To address these questions, an FprA has been characterized from the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The gene encoding this D. vulgaris FprA lies downstream of an operon encoding superoxide reductase and rubredoxin, consistent with an O2-scavenging oxidase function for this FprA. The recombinant D. vulgaris FprA can indeed serve as the terminal component of an NADH oxidase. However, this oxidase turnover results in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. On the other hand, the recombinant D. vulgaris FprA shows robust anaerobic nitric oxide reductase activity in vitro and also protects a nitric oxide-sensitive Escherichia coli strain against exposure to exogenous nitric oxide. It is, therefore, proposed that this D. vulgaris FprA functions as a scavenging nitric oxide reductase in vivo and that this activity protects D. vulgaris against anaerobic exposure to nitric oxide. The location of a gene encoding a second FprA homologue in the D. vulgaris genome also suggests its involvement in nitrogen oxide metabolism.},

  abstract = {Date and latitude interact to determine photoperiod, the daily period of daylight. This interaction has important implications for latitudinal migrants for whom daylight may be a resource or for whom photoperiod regulates annual transitions in life-history stages (i.e. birds). Using an established formula, we developed user-interactive, animated models that enable the visualization of how latitude and date determine photoperiod for latitudinal migrants. We also calculated the photoperiodic schedules for a broad range of hypothetical migratory programmes and real migratory programmes newly available through the proliferation of citizen-science data. This enabled us to infer the limitations some migratory programmes place on mechanisms for photoperiodic regulation of annual breeding. In the vast majority of cases, the act of migrating elevates annual daylight exposure. This raises the hypothesis that daylight availability selects for latitudinal migration, potentially contributing to its evolution in animals such as diurnal birds with limited time during the spring and summer to feed young. However, photoperiodic mechanisms regulating annual cycles could constrain the evolution of such migrations, depending on how they affect photoperiodic schedules. Most migratory programmes are consistent with known mechanisms of avian photoperiodism, but the range of feasible mechanisms declines for transequatorial migrants, which experience semi-annual, 180{$^\circ$}-phase-shifts in their photoperiodic cycles. Understanding photoperiodic constraints on migration is particularly important in this age of changing latitudinal distributions and phenologies driven by climate change.

All strains were found to be able to shortly utilize moderate or even high light, but the low-light strains bleached rapidly in moderate light. Measurements of photoinhibition in the presence of the antibiotic lincomycin showed that a low-light Prochlorococcus strain was more sensitive than a high-light strain and both were more sensitive than the marine Synechococcus. The action spectrum of photoinhibition showed an increase from blue to ultraviolet wavelengths in all strains, suggesting contribution of manganese absorption to photoinhibition, but blue light caused less photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than expected on the basis of earlier results from plants and cyanobacteria. The visible-light part of the action spectrum resembled the absorption spectrum of the organism, suggesting that photosynthetic antenna pigments, especially divinyl chlorophylls, have a more important role as photoreceptors of visible-light photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than in other photoautotrophs.},

  abstract = {Marine cyanobacteria of the genus Prochlorococcus belong to one of two ecotypes that are specifically adapted to either low light (LL) or high light (HL) conditions. Previous analyses of the differences in pigmentation and gene complement revealed that LL-adapted ecotypes carry a gene cluster to produce a functional phycoerythrin, whereas in the fully sequenced genome of the HL-adapted strain MED4, only a single and free-standing cpeB gene occurs. This gene encodes a derived form of beta-phycoerythrin, the function of which has remained enigmatic so far. Here, an analysis of HL-adapted Prochlorococcus strains from different ocean provinces revealed the presence of a cpeB gene highly similar to that of MED4. To investigate whether the presence of particular phycoerythrin genes is a common characteristic of the LL- and HL-adapted ecotypes, primer sets targeting specific motifs in LL-cpeB and HL-cpeB were designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of Red Sea phytoplankton. A major PCR product for Prochlorococcus HL-cpeB was obtained from samples taken at 5-70 m depth and for LL-cpeB from 70-125 m. The high sensitivity of this approach allowed the detection of HL-cpeB down to 100 m and LL-cpeB as deep as 175 m. DNA sequence and phylogenetic analysis of 70 individual clones for HL-cpeB and of 68 clones for LL-cpeB revealed a monophyletic origin for the HL and LL sequences respectively. This study shows that cpeB sequences are suitable as very sensitive molecular markers for the study of natural populations of Prochlorococcus. The low sequence divergence of HL-cpeB among Prochlorococcus strains, which have been isolated from the Mediterranean Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Southern Pacific Ocean as well as in populations from the Red Sea, suggests the HL-cpeB gene to be conserved and its product to be functional in Prochlorococcus.},

The existence of a signaling pathway for the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was suggested by the presence of genes that responded similarly to red and blue light as well as genes that responded to the addition of DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-               N               -               N               {$\prime$}-dimethylurea], a specific inhibitor of photosystem II-mediated electron transport.},

  abstract = {In the high-light-adapted unicellular marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus sp. MED4 the cpeB gene is the only gene coding for a structural phycobiliprotein. The absence of any other phycoerythrin gene in the fully sequenced genome of this organism, the previous inability to detect a gene product, and the mutation of two out of four cysteine residues, normally involved in binding chromophores, suggested that MED4-cpeB might not code for a functional protein. Here, transcription of MED4-cpeB at a low level was detected and the transcriptional start site was mapped. Enrichment of the protein identified phycoerythrobilin as its sole chromophore in vivo, which was confirmed by chromophorylation assays in vitro using the recombinant protein. Phycourobilin is the major chromophore in low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus ecotypes such as strain SS120. Therefore, spectrally tuned phycoerythrins are a characteristic feature of distinct Prochlorococcus ecotypes. Further in vitro mutagenesis experiments replacing one or both cysteines C61R/C82S by arginine or serine, respectively, revealed that only Cys82 is required for chromophore binding. Thus, an unusual green light-absorbing phycoerythrin evolved in the high-light-adapted ecotypes of Prochlorococcus, which potentially serves as a photoreceptor.},

The oxygen decrease in the 300- to 700-m layer is 0.09 to 0.34 micromoles per kilogram per year. Reduced oxygen levels may have dramatic consequences for ecosystems and coastal economies.

  abstract = {The oceanic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus are globally important, ecologically diverse primary producers. It is thought that their viruses (phages) mediate population sizes and affect the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts. Here we present an analysis of genomes from three Prochlorococcus phages: a podovirus and two myoviruses. The morphology, overall genome features, and gene content of these phages suggest that they are quite similar to T7-like (P-SSP7) and T4-like (P-SSM2 and P-SSM4) phages. Using the existing phage taxonomic framework as a guideline, we examined genome sequences to establish ``core'' genes for each phage group. We found the podovirus contained 15 of 26 core T7-like genes and the two myoviruses contained 43 and 42 of 75 core T4-like genes. In addition to these core genes, each genome contains a significant number of ``cyanobacterial'' genes, i.e., genes with significant best BLAST hits to genes found in cyanobacteria. Some of these, we speculate, represent ``signature'' cyanophage genes. For example, all three phage genomes contain photosynthetic genes (psbA, hliP) that are thought to help maintain host photosynthetic activity during infection, as well as an aldolase family gene (talC) that could facilitate alternative routes of carbon metabolism during infection. The podovirus genome also contains an integrase gene (int) and other features that suggest it is capable of integrating into its host. If indeed it is, this would be unprecedented among cultured T7-like phages or marine cyanophages and would have significant evolutionary and ecological implications for phage and host. Further, both myoviruses contain phosphate-inducible genes (phoH and pstS) that are likely to be important for phage and host responses to phosphate stress, a commonly limiting nutrient in marine systems. Thus, these marine cyanophages appear to be variations of two well-known phages---T7 and T4---but contain genes that, if functional, reflect adaptations for infection of photosynthetic hosts in low-nutrient oceanic environments.},

Recently, it was discovered that Gram-positive pathogens use a unique heme biosynthesis pathway, which implicates this pathway as a target for development of antibacterial therapies. We report here the identification of a small-molecule activator of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CgoX) from Gram-positive bacteria, an enzyme essential for heme biosynthesis. Activation of CgoX induces accumulation of coproporphyrin III and leads to photosensitization of Gram-positive pathogens. In combination with light, CgoX activation reduces bacterial burden in murine models of SSTI. Thus, small-molecule activation of CgoX represents an effective strategy for the development of light-based antimicrobial therapies.},

Prochlorococcus has remained a genetically intractable bacterium due to slow growth rates and low transformation efficiencies using standard techniques. Our recent successes in cloning and genetically engineering the AT-rich, 1.1 Mb Mycoplasma mycoides genome in yeast encouraged us to explore similar methods with Prochlorococcus . Prochlorococcus MED4 has an AT-rich genome, with a GC content of 30.8\%, similar to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (38\%), and contains abundant yeast replication origin consensus sites (ACS) evenly distributed around its 1.66 Mb genome. Unlike Mycoplasma cells, which use the UGA codon for tryptophane, Prochlorococcus uses the standard genetic code. Despite this, we observed no toxic effects of several partial and 15 whole Prochlorococcus MED4 genome clones in S. cerevisiae . Sequencing of a Prochlorococcus genome purified from yeast identified 14 single base pair missense mutations, one frameshift, one single base substitution to a stop codon and one dinucleotide transversion compared to the donor genomic DNA. We thus provide evidence of transformation, replication and maintenance of this 1.66 Mb intact bacterial genome in S. cerevisiae.},

  abstract = {Over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport (PET) chain should be avoided, because the accumulation of reducing electron carriers produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) within photosystem I (PSI) in thylakoid membranes and causes oxidative damage to chloroplasts. To prevent production of ROS in thylakoid membranes the H+ gradient ({$\Delta$}pH) needs to be built up across the thylakoid membranes to suppress the over-reduction state of the PET chain. In this study, we aimed to identify the critical component that stimulates {$\Delta$}pH formation under illumination in higher plants. To do this, we screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the formation of {$\Delta$}pH is impaired and the PET chain caused over-reduction under illumination. Subsequently, we isolated an allelic mutant that carries a missense mutation in the {$\gamma$}-subunit of chloroplastic CF0CF1-ATP synthase, named hope2. We found that hope2 suppressed the formation of {$\Delta$}pH during photosynthesis because of the high H+ efflux activity from the lumenal to stromal side of the thylakoid membranes via CF0CF1-ATP synthase. Furthermore, PSI was in a more reduced state in hope2 than in wild-type (WT) plants, and hope2 was more vulnerable to PSI photoinhibition than WT under illumination. These results suggested that chloroplastic CF0CF1-ATP synthase adjusts the redox state of the PET chain, especially for PSI, by modulating H+ efflux activity across the thylakoid membranes. Our findings suggest the importance of the buildup of {$\Delta$}pH depending on CF0CF1-ATP synthase to adjust the redox state of the reaction center chlorophyll P700 in PSI and to suppress the production of ROS in PSI during photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Photosystem I (PSI) photoinhibition suppresses plant photosynthesis and growth. However, the mechanism underlying PSI photoinhibition has not been fully clarified. In this study, in order to investigate the mechanism of PSI photoinhibition in higher plants, we applied repetitive short-pulse (rSP) illumination, which causes PSI-specific photoinhibition in chloroplasts isolated from spinach leaves. We found that rSP treatment caused PSI photoinhibition, but not PSII photoinhibition in isolated chloroplasts in the presence of O2. However, chloroplastic superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities failed to protect PSI from its photoinhibition. Importantly, PSI photoinhibition was largely alleviated in the presence of methyl viologen, which stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the stromal region by accepting electrons from PSI, even under the conditions where CuZn-superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were inactivated by KCN. These results suggest that the ROS production site, but not the ROS production rate, is critical for PSI photoinhibition. Furthermore, we found that not only superoxide (O2 ~-) but also singlet oxygen (1O2) is involved in PSI photoinhibition induced by rSP treatment. From these results, we suggest that PSI photoinhibition is caused by both O2 ~- and 1O2 produced within the thylakoid membranes when electron carriers in PSI become highly reduced. Here, we show, to our knowledge, new insight into the PSI photoinhibition in higher plants.},

The stoichiometry of 3ATP/2NADPH = 12H+/4e- is the absolute requirement for CO2 reduction. For a half of a century it has been a common belief that violations of this stoichiometry are corrected by cyclic electron transport (CET) during which some electrons are cycling around photosystem I (PSI) in an H+ coupled way. Though CET was detected in plant leaves, its rate was never exactly quantified, as well the amount of CET-related ATP synthesis was not compared with the actual ATP needs. In this work CET rate was measured and the assumed ATP synthesis quantified in leaves under experimental conditions where the metabolic ATP consumption was reduced to minimum. Differently from the present common belief, CET rate is at maximum when ATP is at maximum and its additional synthesis is unnecessary. The conclusion is that CET is variably coupled with transmembrane H+ translocation. Therefore the new model of CET is developed to explain this situation.},

  abstract = {The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the dominant phototroph in surface waters of the vast oligotrophic oceans, the foundation of marine food webs, and an important component of global biogeochemical cycles. The prominence of Prochlorococcus across the environmental gradients of the open ocean is attributed to its extensive genetic diversity and flexible chlorophyll physiology, enabling light capture over a wide range of intensities. What remains unknown is the balance between temporal dynamics of genetic diversity and chlorophyll physiology in the ability of Prochlorococcus to respond to a variety of short (approximately 1 day) and longer (months to year) changes in the environment. Previous field research established depth-dependent Prochlorococcus single cell chlorophyll distributions in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Here, we examined whether the shifts in chlorophyll distributions correspond to changes in Prochlorococcus genetic diversity (i.e., ecotype-level community structure) or photoacclimation of stable communities over short time intervals. We report that community structure was relatively stable despite abrupt shifts in Prochlorococcus chlorophyll physiology, due to unexpected physiological plasticity of high-light adapted Prochlorococcus ecotypes. Through comparison with seasonalscale changes, our data suggest that variability on daily scales triggers shifts in Prochlorococcus photoacclimation, while seasonal-scale dynamics trigger shifts in community structure. Together, these data highlight the importance of incorporating the process of photoacclimation and chlorophyll dynamics into interpretations of phytoplankton population dynamics from chlorophyll data as well as the importance of daily-scale variability to Prochlorococcus ecology.},

  abstract = {Safe and efficient conversion of solar energy to metabolic energy by plants is based on tightly inter-regulated transfer of excitation energy, electrons and protons in the photosynthetic machinery according to the availability of light energy, as well as the needs and restrictions of metabolism itself. Plants have mechanisms to enhance the capture of energy when light is limited for growth and development. Also, when energy is in excess, the photosynthetic machinery slows down the electron transfer reactions in order to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species and the consequent damage of the photosynthetic machinery. In this opinion paper, we present a partially hypothetical scheme describing how the photosynthetic machinery controls the flow of energy and electrons in order to enable the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in nature under continual fluctuations in white light intensity. We discuss the roles of light-harvesting II protein phosphorylation, thermal dissipation of excess energy and the control of electron transfer by cytochrome b6f, and the role of dynamically regulated turnover of photosystem II in the maintenance of the photosynthetic machinery. We present a new hypothesis suggesting that most of the regulation in the thylakoid membrane occurs in order to prevent oxidative damage of photosystem I.}

We characterized and compared the three-dimensional architecture of the ecologically important cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus in a near-native state using cryo-electron tomography and found that closely related strains have diverged substantially in cellular organization and structure. By visualizing native, hydrated structures within cells, we discovered that the MED4 strain, which possesses one of the smallest genomes (1.66 Mbp) of any known photosynthetic organism, has evolved a comparatively streamlined cellular architecture. This strain possesses a smaller cell volume, an attenuated cell wall, and less extensive intracytoplasmic (photosynthetic) membrane system compared to the more deeply branched MIT9313 strain. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that differences have evolved in key structural genes, including those encoding enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Although both strains possess carboxysomes that are polygonal and cluster in the central cytoplasm, the carboxysomes of MED4 are smaller. A streamlined cellular structure could be advantageous to microorganisms thriving in the low-nutrient conditions characteristic of large regions of the open ocean and thus have consequences for ecological niche differentiation. Through cryo-electron tomography we visualized, for the first time, the three-dimensional structure of the extensive network of photosynthetic lamellae within Prochlorococcus and the potential pathways for intracellular and intermembrane movement of molecules. Comparative information on the near-native structure of microorganisms is an important and necessary component of exploring microbial diversity and understanding its consequences for function and ecology.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a major photosynthetic prokaryote in nutrient-limited, open ocean environments and an important participant in the global carbon cycle. This phototroph is distinct from other members of the cyanobacterial lineage to which it belongs because it utilizes a chlorophyll a2/b(2) light-harvesting complex as its major antenna, instead of phycobilisomes. Recently, genes encoding the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin were identified in several Prochlorococcus isolates, thus making it the only extant photosynthetic prokaryote to possess a chlorophyll a/b antenna as well as phycobiliprotein genes. In order to understand the evolution of phycobiliproteins in this genus, the authors have sequenced the phycoerythrin genes of two isolates that are the most deeply branching in the Prochlorococcus lineage and share the highest degree of 16S rDNA sequence similarity to phycobilisome-containing marine SYNECHOCOCCUS: Sequence analyses suggest that within the Prochlorococcus lineage, the selective forces shaping the evolution of the phycoerythrin gene set have not been uniform. Although strains that are most closely related to marine Synechococcus possess genes (cpeB, cpeA) encoding both subunits of phycoerythrin, a more recently evolved strain is shown to lack cpeA and to possess a degenerate form of cpeB. Differences in phycoerythrin gene sequences between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus appear to be consistent with a model of elevated mutation rates rather than relaxed selection. This suggests that although phycoerythrin is not a major constituent of the light-harvesting apparatus in Prochlorococcus, as it is in Synechococcus, the cpeB and cpeA genes are still under selection, albeit a different type of selection than in Synechococcus. The evolution of the Prochlorococcus light-harvesting antenna complex provides an important system for understanding the origins and scope of phylogenetic diversity in ocean ecosystems.},

The photosynthetic 02 F is defined as the atmospheric 02 level, with a given CO2 level and temperature, at which net 02 exchange is zero. In experiments with C3 plants, the 02 F with 220 ppm CO2 is 23\% 02; 02 F increases to 27\% with 350 ppm CO2 and to 35\% 02 with 700 ppm CO2. At 02 levels below the 02 F, C02 uptake and reduction are accompanied by net 02 evolution. At 02 levels above the 02 F, net 02 uptake occurs with a reduced rate of CO2 fixation, more carbohydrates are oxidized by photorespiration to products of the C2 oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle, and plants senesce prematurely. The C02 F increases from 50 ppm CO2 with 21\% 02 to 220 ppm with 100\% 02. At a low C02/high 02 ratio that inhibits the carboxylase activity of Rubisco, much malate accumulates, which suggests that the oxygen-insensitive phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase becomes a significant component of the lower CO2 fixation rate. Because of low global levels of CO2 and a Rubisco specificity that favors the carboxylase activity, relatively rapid changes in the atmospheric CO2 level should control the permissive 02 F that could lead to slow changes in the immense 02 pool.},

  abstract = {{$\ast$}I wish to dedicate this review to my son Joonas. I will miss you forever.Photoinhibition of Photosystem II (PSII) is the light-induced loss of PSII electron-transfer activity. Although photoinhibition has been studied for a long time, there is no consensus about its mechanism. On one hand, production of singlet oxygen (1O2) by PSII has promoted models in which this reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered to act as the agent of photoinhibitory damage. These chemistry-based models have often not taken into account the photophysical features of photoinhibition-like light response and action spectrum. On the other hand, models that reproduce these basic photophysical features of the reaction have not considered the importance of data about ROS. In this chapter, it is shown that the evidence behind the chemistry-based models and the photophysically oriented models can be brought together to build a mechanism that confirms with all types of experimental data. A working hypothesis is proposed, starting with inhibition of the manganese complex by light. Inability of the manganese complex to reduce the primary donor promotes recombination between the oxidized primary donor and QA, the first stable quinone acceptor of PSII. 1O2 production due to this recombination may inhibit protein synthesis or spread the photoinhibitory damage to another PSII center. The production of 1O2 is transient because loss of activity of the oxygen-evolving complex induces an increase in the redox potential of QA, which lowers 1O2 production.},

The use of transmembrane chlorophyll complexes instead of phycobilisomes as light-harvesting antennae is considered a defining attribute of Prochlorococcus. Its ecology and evolution are understood in terms of light, temperature, and nutrients. Here, we report single-cell genomic information on previously uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages of this genus from nutrient-rich anoxic waters of the eastern tropical North and South Pacific Ocean. The most basal lineages exhibit optical and genotypic properties of phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria, indicating that the characteristic light-harvesting antenna of the group is not an ancestral attribute. Additionally, we found that all the indigenous lineages analyzed encode genes for pigment biosynthesis under oxygen-limited conditions, a trait shared with other freshwater and coastal marine cyanobacteria. Our findings thus suggest that Prochlorococcus diverged from other cyanobacteria under low-oxygen conditions before transitioning from phycobilisomes to transmembrane chlorophyll complexes and may have contributed to the oxidation of the ancient ocean.},

They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ``end points'' represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.},

We have studied the transcriptional, metabolic and photo-physiological responses to light of different spectral quality in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum through time-series studies of cultures exposed to equal doses of photosynthetically usable radiation of blue, green and red light. The experiments showed that short-term differences in gene expression and profiles are mainly light quality-dependent. Transcription of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes was activated mainly through a light quality-independent mechanism likely to rely on chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling. In contrast, genes encoding proteins important for photoprotection and PSII repair were highly dependent on a blue light receptor-mediated signal. Changes in energy transfer efficiency by light-harvesting pigments were spectrally dependent; furthermore, a declining trend in photosynthetic efficiency was observed in red light. The combined results suggest that diatoms possess a light quality-dependent ability to activate photoprotection and efficient repair of photodamaged PSII. In spite of approximately equal numbers of PSII-absorbed quanta in blue, green and red light, the spectral quality of light is important for diatom responses to ambient light conditions.},

In axenic cultures of Prochlorococcus, it was observed that {$<$}1\% of the total PO43- uptake was incorporated into membrane lipids. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry of planktonic lipids in the NPSG confirmed that SQDG was the dominant membrane lipid. Furthermore, the analyses of SQDG synthesis genes from the Sargasso Sea environmental genome showed that the use of sulfolipids in subtropical gyres was confined primarily to picocyanobacteria; no sequences related to known heterotrophic bacterial SQDG lineages were found. This biochemical adaptation by Prochlorococcus must be a significant benefit to these organisms, which compete against phospholipid-rich heterotrophic bacteria for PO43-. Thus, evolution of this ``sulfur-for-phosphorus'' strategy set the stage for the success of picocyanobacteria in oligotrophic environments and may have been a major event in Earth's early history when the relative availability of sulfate and PO43- were significantly different from today's ocean.},

Without methods that allow for a range of responses, erroneous conclusions can be drawn, especially for large, multi-time-series datasets, which are increasingly available. Drawing on literature in other disciplines and pioneering work in ecology, we present a standardised framework to robustly assesses how interventions, like natural disasters or conservation policies, affect ecological time series.},

Yet, to what extent interactions differ between closely related organisms, or how these interactions change over time, or culture conditions, remains unclear. Here, we characterize the interactions between five strains each of two globally abundant marine microorganisms, Prochlorococcus (phototroph) and Alteromonas (heterotroph), from the first encounter between individual strains and over more than a year of repeated cycles of exponential growth and long-term nitrogen starvation. Prochlorococcus-Alteromonas interactions had little effect on traditional growth parameters such as Prochlorococcus growth rate, maximal fluorescence, or lag phase, affecting primarily the dynamics of culture decline, which we interpret as representing cell mortality and lysis. The shape of the Prochlorococcus decline curve and the carrying capacity of the co-cultures were determined by the phototroph and not the heterotroph strains involved. Comparing various mathematical models of culture mortality suggests that Prochlorococcus death rate increases over time in mono-cultures but decreases in co-cultures, with cells potentially becoming more resistant to stress. Our results demonstrate intra-species differences in ecologically relevant co-culture outcomes. These include the recycling efficiency of N and whether the interactions are mutually synergistic or competitive. They also highlight the information-rich growth and death curves as a useful readout of the interaction phenotype.},

The hybridization of high-light (HL) and low-light (LL) Prochlorococcus genotype-specific probes to two depth profiles of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA sequences revealed that in these two stratified water columns, an obvious niche-partitioning ofProchlorococcus genotypes occurred. In each water column a shift from the HL to the LL genotype was observed, a transition correlating with the depth of the surface mixed layer (SML). Only the HL genotype was found in the SML in each water column, whereas the LL genotype was distributed below the SML. The range of in situ irradiance to which each genotype was subjected within these distinct niches was consistent with growth irradiance studies of cultured HL- and LL-adapted Prochlorococcus strains. DGGE analysis and the sequencing of Prochlorococcus 16S rDNA clones were in full agreement with the genotype-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization data. These observations of a partitioning ofProchlorococcus genotypes in a stratified water column provide a genetic basis for the dim and brightProchlorococcus populations observed in flow cytometric signatures in several oceanic provinces.},

This clade, named HNLC fell within the HL-adapted Prochlorococcus clade with sequences above 99\% similarity to one another, and was divided into two subclades, HNLC1 and HNLC2. The distribution of the whole HNLC clade in a northwest to southeast transect in the South Pacific (HNLC-to-gyre) and two 8{$^\circ$}N to 8{$^\circ$}S transects in the Equatorial Pacific was determined by quantitative PCR using specific primers targeting ITS regions. HNLC was the dominant HL Prochlorococcus clade (2--9\% of bacterial 16S rRNA genes) at the three westernmost stations in the South Pacific but decreased to less than 0.1\% at the other stations being replaced by the eMIT9312 ecotype in the hyperoligotrophic gyre. The highest contributions of HNLC Prochlorococcus in both Equatorial Pacific transects along the latitudinal lines of 170{$^\circ$}W and 155{$^\circ$}W were observed at the southernmost stations, reaching 16 and 6\% of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, respectively, whereas eMIT9312 dominated near the Equator. Spearman Rank Order correlation analysis indicated that although both the HNLC clade and eMIT9312 were correlated with temperature, they showed different correlations with regard to nutrients. HNLC only showed significant correlations to ammonium uptake and regeneration rates, whereas eMIT9312 was negatively correlated with inorganic nutrients.},

Found in the world's oceans Prochlorococcus is very small in size and possesses the smallest genome of a photosynthetic autotroph. Prochlorococcus is characterized by a special chlorophyll antenna for light harvesting and the absence of classical cyanobacterial phycobilisomes. Despite the lack of phycobilisomes Prochlorococcus possesses remnants thereof which is the phycobiliprotein phycoerythrin (PE) encoded in a PE operon as well as genes encoding enzymes of phycobilin biosynthesis. The size of this PE operon varies depending on the light-adapted ecotype. While high-light strains only possess a {$\beta$}-subunit of PE, low-light adapted strains possess both, an {$\alpha$}- and a {$\beta$}-subunit. {$\alpha$}-/{$\beta$}-subunits are also present in functional phycobilisomes. Consistent with the number of subunits is also the varying number of putative lyase genes, involved in the transfer and attachment of phycobilins (open-chain tetrapyrroles) to the PE subunits. This minireview summarizes the only sparely available data on the biosynthesis and assembly of Prochlorococcus PE. On one hand the quite well understood biosynthesis of pigments will be reviewed but also new data on the phycobiliprotein lyase-mediated transfer of the phycobilins to the PE subunits will be discussed.},

  abstract = {A simple method for whole-cell hybridization using fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes was developed for use in marine cyanobacterial picoplankton. In contrast to established protocols, this method is capable of detecting rRNA in Prochlorococcus, the most abundant unicellular marine cyanobacterium. Because the method avoids the use of alcohol fixation, the chlorophyll content of Prochlorococcus cells is preserved, facilitating the identification of these cells in natural samples. PNA probe-conferred fluorescence was measured flow cytometrically and was always significantly higher than that of the negative control probe, with positive/negative ratio varying between 4 and 10, depending on strain and culture growth conditions. Prochlorococcus cells from open ocean samples were detectable with this method. RNase treatment reduced probe-conferred fluorescence to background levels, demonstrating that this signal was in fact related to the presence of rRNA. In another marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, in which both PNA and oligonucleotide probes can be used in whole-cell hybridizations, the magnitude of fluorescence from the former was fivefold higher than that from the latter, although the positive/negative ratio was comparable for both probes. In Synechococcus cells growing at a range of growth rates (and thus having different rRNA concentrations per cell), the PNA- and oligonucleotide-derived signals were highly correlated (r = 0.99). The chemical nature of PNA, the sensitivity of PNA-RNA binding to single-base-pair mismatches, and the preservation of cellular integrity by this method suggest that it may be useful for phylogenetic probing of whole cells in the natural environment.},

The DIP concentrations in this area (which receives high inputs of iron-rich dust from arid regions of North Africa) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than surface levels in the North Pacific (where eolian iron inputs are much lower and water column denitrification is much more substantial). These data indicate a severe relative phosphorus depletion in the Atlantic. We hypothesize that nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation of primary production in the present-day ocean may be closely linked to iron supply through control of dinitrogen (N2) fixation, an iron-intensive metabolic process. Although the oceanic phosphorus inventory may set the upper limit for the total amount of organic matter produced in the ocean over geological time scales, at any instant in geological time, oceanic primary production may fall below this limit because of a persistent insufficient iron supply. By controlling N2 fixation, iron may control not only nitrogen versus phosphorus limitation but also carbon fixation and export stoichiometry and hence biological sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

  abstract = {The various photosynthetic apparatus and light utilization strategies of phytoplankton are among the critical factors that regulate the distribution of phytoplankton and primary productivity in the ocean. Active chlorophyll fluorescence has been a powerful technique for assessing the nutritional status of phytoplankton by studying the dynamics of photosynthesis. Further studies of the energetic stoichiometry between light absorption and carbon fixation have enhanced understanding of the ways phytoplankton adapt to their niches. To explore the ecophysiology of a Prochlorococcus-dominated phytoplankton assemblage, we conducted studies of the diel patterns of variable fluorescence and carbon fixation by phytoplankton in the oligotrophic South China Sea (SCS) basin in June 2017. We found that phytoplankton photosynthetic performance at stations SEATS and SS1 were characterized by a nocturnal decrease, dawn maximum, and midday decrease of the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv({$\prime$})/Fm({$\prime$}), which has been denoted as both Fv/Fm and Fv{$\prime$}/Fm{$\prime$}) in the nutrient-depleted surface layer. That these diel patterns of Fv({$\prime$})/Fm({$\prime$}) were similar to those in the tropical Pacific Ocean suggests macro-nutrient and potentially micro-nutrient stress. However, the fact that variations were larger in the central basin than at the basin's edge implied variability in the degree of nutrient limitation in the basin. The estimated molar ratio of gross O2 production to net production of carbon (GOP:NPC) of 4.9:1 was similar to ratios reported across the world's oceans. The narrow range of the GOP:NPC ratios is consistent with the assumption that there is a common strategy for photosynthetic energy allocation by phytoplankton. That photo-inactivated photosystems or nonphotochemical quenching rather than GOP accounted for most of the radiation absorbed by phytoplankton explains why the maximum quantum yield of carbon fixation was rather low in the oligotrophic SCS.},

Environmental factors could alter the contents and compositions of cyanobacteria glyceroglycolipids, but the regulation mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the glyceroglycolipids contents and the transcriptome in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were analyzed under phosphate starvation. Under phosphate starvation, the decrease of monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) and increases of digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG) and sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) led to a decrease in the MGDG/DGDG ratio, from 4:1 to 5:3, after 12 days of cultivation. However, UDP\&ndash;sulfoquinovose synthase gene sqdB, and the SQDG synthase gene sqdX, were down-regulated, and the decreased MGDG/DGDG ratio was later increased back to 2:1 after 15 days of cultivation, suggesting the regulation of glyceroglycolipids on day 12 was based on the MGDG/DGDG ratio maintaining glyceroglycolipid homeostasis. There are 12 differentially expressed transcriptional regulators that could be potential candidates related to glyceroglycolipid regulation, according to the transcriptome analysis. The transcriptome analysis also suggested post-transcriptional or post-translational regulations in glyceroglycolipid synthesis. This study provides further insights into glyceroglycolipid metabolism, as well as the scientific basis for glyceroglycolipid synthesis optimization and cyanobacteria glyceroglycolipids utilization via metabolic engineering.},

Prochlorococcus can be broadly divided into high-light-adapted (HL) and low-light-adapted (LL) clades. In this study, we isolated two low-light-adapted clade I (LLI) strains from the western Pacific Ocean and obtained their genomic data. We reconstructed Prochlorococcus evolution based on genome rearrangement. Our results showed that genome rearrangement might have played an important role in Prochlorococcus evolution. We also found that the Prochlorococcus clades with streamlined genomes maintained relatively high synteny throughout most of their genomes, and several regions served as rearrangement hotspots. Backbone analysis showed that different clades shared a conserved backbone but also had clade-specific regions, and the genes in these regions were associated with ecological adaptations. IMPORTANCE Prochlorococcus, the most abundant and smallest known free-living photosynthetic microorganism, plays a key role in marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Prochlorococcus genome evolution is a fundamental issue related to how Prochlorococcus clades adapted to different ecological niches. Recent studies revealed that the gene gain and loss is crucial to the clade differentiation. The significance of our research is that we interpreted the Prochlorococcus genome evolution from the perspective of genome structure and associated the genome rearrangement with the Prochlorococcus clade differentiation and subsequent ecological adaptation.},

The non-rectangular hyperbolic model (hereafter, NH model) has been widely used to characterize light response of net photosynthesis rate (An; An--I curve) and J--I curve. However, NH model has been reported to overestimate the maximum An (Anmax) and the maximum J (Jmax), largely due to its asymptotic function. Meanwhile, few efforts have been delivered for describing JC--I and JO--I curves. The long-standing challenge on describing An--I and J--I curves have been resolved by a recently developed An--I and J--I models (hereafter, Ye model), which adopt a nonasymptotic function. To test whether Ye model can resolve the challenge of NH model in reproducing J--I, JC--I and JO--I curves over light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibitory I levels, we compared the performances of Ye model and NH model against measurements on two C3 crops (Triticum aestivum L. and Glycine max L.) grown in field. The results showed that NH model significantly overestimated the Anmax and Jmax for both species, which can be accurately obtained by Ye model. Furthermore, NH model significantly overestimated the maximum electron flow for carboxylation (JC-max) but not the maximum electron flow for oxygenation (JO-max) for both species, disclosing the reason underlying the long-standing problem of NH model---overestimation of Jmax and Anmax.},

  abstract = {Recently, studies on the influences of physico-chemical properties of water masses on the distribution of Synechococcus have been conducted. In addition, it is known that different types of Synechococcus can be identified based on its phycoerythrin (PE) chromophores, which are phycourobilin (PUB) and phycoerythrobilin (PEB). This study observed the abundance of Synechococcus and its phycoerythrin chromophores based on the excitation ratio of PUB and PEB, and also examined the major environmental factors which influence the distribution of Synechococcus in the East Sea during autumn 2011 and spring 2012. Surface distribution showed that the abundance of Synechococcus in autumn was higher than that in spring (6.5 {\textpm} 4.7 {\texttimes} 103 cells ml-1 in autumn and 1.2 {\textpm} 0.9 {\texttimes} 103 cells ml-1 in spring) when water temperature was warmer and nutrient level was higher. Vertical distribution of Synechococcus abundance showed sub-surface maxima for both seasons between 10--30 m depth. Surface distribution of the PUBEX:PEBEX ratio was found in a slightly similar range between autumn and spring (0.83--1.45 in autumn and 0.82--1.34 in spring). Vertical distribution of the PUBEX:PEBEX ratio ranged between 0.77--1.57 and 0.82--1.42 in autumn and spring, respectively. This study is one of the very few studies that examined the PUBEX:PEBEX ratio in the natural samples and found three different types of Synechococcus based on its PUBEX:PEBEX ratio: high PUBEX:PEBEX ratios ({$>$} 1) in warm surface layers and in the deeper layers for both seasons; low PUBEX:PEBEX ratios ({$<$} 1) in the surface layer in autumn; and a few PUB-lacking Synechococcus. The distribution of the PUBEX:PEBEX ratio was clearly associated with temperature and salinity in which a low PUBEX:PEBEX ratio coincided with colder and less saline water, and vice versa.},

We also identify cell size as a key factor that contributes to the species-effect of this correlation. Phosphate limitation results in larger cells and contributes to a small decrease in sulfur isotope fractionation concomitant with an apparent increase in cell-specific sulfate reduction rates. Sulfur isotope fractionation in phosphate-limited cultures asymptotically approaches a lower limit of approximately 5‰ as cell-specific sulfate reduction rates increase to {$>$}100 fmol cell-1 day-1. These experimental results test models that link the reversibilities of enzymatic steps in dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfur isotope fractionation and show that these models can provide consistent predictions across large variations in physiological states experienced by sulfate reducing bacteria.},

  abstract = {The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a well-established model organism, has been widely used in dissecting glycerolipid metabolism in oxygenating photosynthetic organisms. In previous studies, it has been found that shunting carbon precursors from the starch synthesis pathway can lead to a 10-fold increase in TAG content as compared to the wild type, but it is unknown whether inactivation of AGPase may affect membrane lipids biosynthesis. The study aims to investigate global changes in lipid metabolism and homeostasis in the starchless mutant C. reinhardtii sta6. By utilizing an electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (ESI/MS)-based lipidomics approach, a total of 105 membrane lipid molecules of C. reinhardtii were resolved, including 16 monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), 16 digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), 11 phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 6 sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), 49 diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS), 2 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 5 phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecules. The quantitative results indicated that the membrane lipid profiles were similar between the two C. reinhardtii strains grown under both low- and high-light conditions, but the cellular contents of a great number of lipids were altered in sta6 due to the defect in starch biosynthesis. Under low-light conditions, sta6 accumulated more PI, MGDG, DGDG but less amounts of DGTS as compared to WT. Under high light, sta6 cells contained higher content membrane lipids than cc-124, except for PG, which is more or less similar in both strains. Our results demonstrate that the cellular membrane lipid homeostasis underwent profound changes in the starchless mutant, and thereby its physiological impact remains to be explored.},

  abstract = {Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a widely used model cyanobacterium, whose substrains can vary on both genotype and phenotype levels. Previously described phenotypic variations include ability of mixotrophic growth, ability of movement on agar plates and variations in pigments composition or cell size. In this study, we report for the first time significant variation among Synechocystis substrains in complex cellular traits such as growth rate, photosynthesis efficiency, cellular dry weight and cellular composition (including protein or carbohydrates content). We also confirmed previously reported differences in cell size. Synechocystis cultures were cultivated in controlled environment of flat panel photobioreactors under red, blue and white light of intensities up to 790 {$\mu$}mol(photons) m-2 s-1, temperatures 23{\r{}}C--60{\r{}}C, input CO2 concentrations ranging from 400 to 15 000 ppm and in BG11 cultivation medium with and without addition of NaCl. Three Synechocystis substrains were used for the comparative experiments: GT-L, GT-B (Brno, CZ) and PCC-B (Brno, CZ). Growth rates of Synechocystis GT-B were inhibited under high intensities of red light (585--670 nm), and growth rates of both substrains GT-B and PCC-B were inhibited under photons of wavelengths 485--585 nm and 670--700 nm. Synechocystis GT-B was more sensitive to low temperatures than the other two tested substrains, and Synechocystis GT-L was sensitive to the presence of NaCl in the cultivation media. The results suggest that stress sensitivity of commonly used Synechocystis substrains can strongly vary, similarly as glucose tolerance or motility as reported previously. Our study further supports the previous statement that emphasizes importance of proper Synechocystis substrains selection and awareness of phenotypical differences among Synechocystis substrains which is crucial for comparative and reproducible research. This is highly relevant for studies related to stress physiology and development of sustainable biotechnological applications.},

To investigate the involvement of proteases in the processes of induction and degradation of the CCM complexes, we studied the FtsH2 (DSlr0228) and Deg-G (DSlr1204/DSll1679/DSll1427) protease mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. WT and protease mutant cells were grown under high CO2 and then shifted to low CO2, followed by a proteome analysis of the membrane protein complexes. Interestingly, in the FtsH2 protease mutant, inducible CCM complexes were not detected upon shift to low CO2, whereas the Deg-G mutant behaved like WT. Also the transcripts of the inducible CCM genes and their regulator ndhR failed to accumulate upon shift of FtsH2 mutant cells from high to low CO2, indicating that the regulation by the FtsH2 protease is upstream of NdhR. Moreover, functional photosynthesis was shown a prerequisite for induction of CCM in WT at low CO2, possibly via generation of oxidative stress, which was shown here to enhance the expression of inducible CCM genes even at high CO2 conditions. Once synthesized, the CCM complexes were not subject to proteolytic degradation, even when dispensable upon a shift of cells to high CO2.},

  abstract = {The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 has the smallest genome and cell size of all known photosynthetic organisms. Like all phototrophs at temperate latitudes, it experiences predictable daily variation in available light energy which leads to temporal regulation and partitioning of key cellular processes. To better understand the tempo and choreography of this minimal phototroph, we studied the entire transcriptome of the cell over a simulated daily light-dark cycle, and placed it in the context of diagnostic physiological and cell cycle parameters. All cells in the culture progressed through their cell cycles in synchrony, thus ensuring that our measurements reflected the behavior of individual cells. Ninety percent of the annotated genes were expressed, and 80\% had cyclic expression over the diel cycle. For most genes, expression peaked near sunrise or sunset, although more subtle phasing of gene expression was also evident. Periodicities of the transcripts of genes involved in physiological processes such as in cell cycle progression, photosynthesis, and phosphorus metabolism tracked the timing of these activities relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, the transitions between photosynthesis during the day and catabolic consumption of energy reserves at night--- metabolic processes that share some of the same enzymes --- appear to be tightly choreographed at the level of RNA expression. In-depth investigation of these patterns identified potential regulatory proteins involved in balancing these opposing pathways. Finally, while this analysis has not helped resolve how a cell with so little regulatory capacity, and a `deficient' circadian mechanism, aligns its cell cycle and metabolism so tightly to a light-dark cycle, it does provide us with a valuable framework upon which to build when the Prochlorococcus proteome and metabolome become available.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) is a reactive oxygen species, derived from molecular oxygen, that is capable of damaging microbial cells. Surprisingly, the HOOH defence systems of some aerobes in the oxygenated marine environments are critically depleted, relative to model aerobes. For instance, the gene encoding catalase is absent in the numerically dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus. Accordingly, Prochlorococcus is highly susceptible to HOOH when exposed as pure cultures. Pure cultures do not exist in the marine environment, however. Catalase-positive community members can remove HOOH from the seawater medium, thus lowering the threat to Prochlorococcus and any other member that likewise lacks their own catalase. This cross-protection may constitute a loosely defined symbiosis, whereby the catalase-positive helper cells may benefit through the acquisition of nutrients released by the beneficiaries such as Prochlorococcus. Other members of the community that may be helped by the catalase-positive cells may include some lineages of Synechococcus -- the sister genus of Prochlorococcus -- as well as some lineages of SAR11 and ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria. The co-occurrence of catalase-positive and -negative members suggests that cross-protection from HOOH-mediated oxidative stress may play an important role in the construction of the marine microbial community.},

More limited regional variation was observed (e.g., Sargasso Sea, Gulf Stream, continental slope, and equatorial current), and local patchiness was minimal. Modeling of a combined North and South Atlantic data set revealed significant, independent effects of light and temperature on ecotype abundances, suggesting that they are key ecological determinants that establish the different habitat ranges of the physiologically and genetically distinct ecotypes. This was in sharp contrast with the genus Synechococcus, whose total abundance was related to light but did not vary in a predictable way with temperature. Comparisons of field abundances with growth characteristics of cultured isolates of Prochlorococcus suggested the presence of ecotypespecific thermal and light adaptations that could be responsible for the distinct distribution patterns of the four dominant ecotypes. Significantly, we discovered that one ``low-light-adapted'' ecotype, eNATL2A, can thrive in deeply mixed surface layers, whereas another, eMIT9313, cannot, even though they have the same growth optimum for (low) light.},

  abstract = {This review surveys the current state of knowledge of the concentrations, sources and sinks of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ocean. Both abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ROS dynamics in seawater, and ROS can feature prominently in marine microbe--microbe interactions. The sun plays a key role in the production of ROS in the ocean, and consequently ROS concentrations are typically maximal in the sun-exposed surface. However, microbes can also contribute significantly to extracellular ROS. Production of superoxide is widespread within the microbial community, and may benefit the producers as antimicrobial agents or perhaps more generally, as a means of nutrient scavenging. Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a community-wide activity, though some members may play less significant roles in this process. The more reactive forms of ROS, singlet oxygen and the hydroxyl radical, may be less important as microbial stressors, as they tend to react with the chemicals in seawater before they can contact the cells. However, exceptions may exist for microbes attached to singlet oxygen-generating sinking particulate matter. Extracellular ROS thus plays an important role in the ecology of marine microbes, the full extent to which we are only beginning to appreciate.},

Materials and methods Mitochondrial respiration was compared in situ in saponin-skinned fibers isolated from the soleus muscles of Wistar rats, in solution enriched in O2 by injection or the electrolytic process 1) at an O2 concentration decreasing from 240 {\textmu}mol/L to 10 {\textmu}mol/L (132 mmHg to 5 mmHg), with glutamate--malate or N, N, N{$\prime$}, N{$\prime$}-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD)--ascorbate (with antimycin A) as substrates; and 2) at increasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentration with glutamate--malate as substrate. Results As expected, maximal respiration decreased with O2 concentration and, when compared to glutamate--malate, the apparent Km O2 of mitochondria for O2 was significantly lower with TMPD--ascorbate with both waters. However, when compared to the water enriched in O2 by injection, the Km O2 was significantly lower with both electron donors in water enriched in O2 by electrolysis. This was not associated with any increase in the sensitivity of mitochondria to ADP; no significant difference was observed for the Km ADP between the two waters. Conclusion In this experiment, a higher affinity of the mitochondria for O2 was observed in water enriched in O2 by electrolysis than by injection. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that O2 diffusion can be facilitated in water enriched in O2 by the electrolytic process.},

The maximum Photosystem II electron transport rates were similar for the two Prochlorococcus strains but higher for the marine Synechococcus strain. Photosystem II electron transport capacity is highly correlated to the molar ratio of RUBISCO active sites to Photosystem II but not to the ratio of cytochrome b6f to Photosystem II, nor to the ratio of Photosystem I: Photosystem II. Thus, the catalytic capacity for the rate-limiting step of carbon fixation, the ultimate electron sink, appears to limit electron transport rates. The high abundance of Cytochrome b6f and Photosystem I in MIT 9313, combined with the slower flow of electrons away from Photosystem II and the relatively low level of RUBISCO, are consistent with cyclic electron flow around Photosystem I in this strain.},

  abstract = {Marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus are picocyanobacteria predominating in subtropical, oligotrophic marine environments, a niche predicted to expand with climate change. When grown under common low light conditions Synechococcus WH 8102 and Prochlorococcus MED 4 show similar Cytochrome b6f and Photosystem I contents normalized to Photosystem II content, while Prochlorococcus MIT 9313 has twice the Cytochrome b6f content and four times the Photosystem I content of the other strains. Interestingly, the Prochlorococcus strains contain only one third to one half of the RUBISCO catalytic subunits compared to the marine Synechococcus strain. The maximum Photosystem II electron transport rates were similar for the two Prochlorococcus strains but higher for the marine Synechococcus strain. Photosystem II electron transport capacity is highly correlated to the molar ratio of RUBISCO active sites to Photosystem II but not to the ratio of cytochrome b6f to Photosystem II, nor to the ratio of Photosystem I: Photosystem II. Thus, the catalytic capacity for the rate-limiting step of carbon fixation, the ultimate electron sink, appears to limit electron transport rates. The high abundance of Cytochrome b6f and Photosystem I in MIT 9313, combined with the slower flow of electrons away from Photosystem II and the relatively low level of RUBISCO, are consistent with cyclic electron flow around Photosystem I in this strain.},
