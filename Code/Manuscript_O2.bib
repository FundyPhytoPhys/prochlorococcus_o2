  abstract = {In this paper we consider large scale nonlinear least-squares problems for which function and gradient are evaluated with dynamic accuracy and propose a Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt method for solving such problems. More precisely, we consider the case in which the exact function to optimize is not available or its evaluation is computationally demanding, but approximations of it are available at any prescribed accuracy level. The proposed method relies on a control of the accuracy level, and imposes an improvement of function approximations when the accuracy is detected to be too low to proceed with the optimization process. We prove global and local convergence and complexity of our procedure and show encouraging numerical results on test problems arising in data assimilation and machine learning.},

  abstract = {Although most phycologists use natural seawater for culturing marine species, artificial media continue to play important roles in overcoming problems of supply and seasonal variability in the quality of natural seawater and also for experiments involving manipulation of micro- and macronutrients. Several artificial media have been developed over the last 90 years; enriched seawater, artificial water (ESAW) is among the more popular recipes. ESAW has the advantage of an ionic balance that is somewhat closer to that of normal seawater. The original paper compared the growth of 83 strains of microalgae in natural seawater (ESNW) versus ESAW and determined that 23\% grew more poorly in the artificial water. Since 1980, however, the composition of ESAW, as used by the original authors, has changed considerably. In particular, the added forms of phosphate, iron, and silicate have been changed and the trace metal mixture has been altered to include nickel, molybdenum, and selenium. We tested whether these changes improved the ability of the artificial medium to grow previously difficult to grow phytoplankton species. To test this, we selected eight species that had been shown to grow better in ESNW than in ESAW and compared their growth again, using the currently used recipe with all the above modifications. For all but one species (Apedinella spinifera), growth rate and final yield was no different between the media but in one case (Emiliania huxleyi) was slightly higher in ESAW. No differences in cell morphology or volume were found in any case. We conclude that changes to the enrichment portion of the recipe have significantly improved this artificial seawater medium and that it can be used to grow an even wider range of coastal and open ocean species.},

Phytoplankton function and acclimation are driven by catalytic protein complexes that mediate key physiological transformations, including generation of photosynthetic ATP and reductant, and carbon and nitrogen fixation. Quantitation of capacities for these processes allows estimation of rates for key ecosystem processes, and identification of factors limiting primary productivity. We herein present molar quantitations of PSI, PSII, ATP synthase, RuBisCO and the Fe protein of nitrogenase of Trichodesmium collected from the Gulf of Mexico, in comparison to determinations for a range of cyanobacteria growing in culture. Using these measurements, estimates were generated for Trichodesmium capacities for carbon fixation of 1-3.4 g C g chl a(-1) h(-1) and nitrogen fixation of 0.06-0.17 g N g chl a(-1) h(-1), with diel variations in capacities. ATP synthase levels show that ATP synthesis capacity is sufficient to support these levels of carbon and nitrogen fixation, and that ATP synthase levels change over the day in accordance with the ATP demands of nitrogenase and RuBisCO activity. Levels of measured complexes indicate that Trichodesmium manifests n-type diel light acclimation through rapid changes in RuBisCO:PSII, supported by significant investment of cellular nitrogen. The plasticity in the levels and stoichiometry of these core complexes show that changes in the abundance of core protein complexes are an important component of acclimation and regulation of metabolic function by Trichodesmium populations.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

Analysis of Prochlorococcus genome sequences from cultured isolates and ocean samples has broadened interest in studying this tiny cell, and efforts are underway to develop it into a model system for studying marine microbial ecology. A critical component of these efforts has been the development of systematic culturing methods that will facilitate the distribution of Prochlorococcus to diverse labs that may be interested in studying it. This paper provides detailed methods for maintaining cultures of Prochlorococcus, including a comparison of growth rates of cells on two artificial seawater media and on a standard medium that uses a natural seawater base. Procedures for agar plating, cryopreservation, obtaining new isolates, and issues associated with culture volume and carbon limitation also are described.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({$\pm$}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

  abstract = {The marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus numerically dominate open ocean phytoplankton. Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to photoinactivation of Photosystem II under a range of light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid photoinactivation than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this photoinactivation. We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of photoinactivation on the basis of photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of photoinactivation of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline photoinactivation across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct photoinactivation of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and photoinactivation as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These differential cost-benefits probably underlie the distinct photoacclimation strategies of the species.},

  abstract = {Proteomics has great potential for studies of marine microbial biogeochemistry, yet high microbial diversity in many locales presents us with unique challenges. We addressed this challenge with a targeted metaproteomics workflow for NtcA and P-II, two nitrogen regulatory proteins, and demonstrated its application for cyanobacterial taxa within microbial samples from the Central Pacific Ocean. Using METATRYP, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less. The related cyanobacteria               Prochlorococcus               and               Synechococcus               shared an average of 4.8 {$\pm$} 1.9\% of their tryptic peptides, while shared intraspecies peptides were higher, 13 {$\pm$} 15\% shared peptides between 12               Prochlorococcus               genomes. An NtcA peptide was found to target multiple cyanobacteria species, whereas a P-II peptide showed specificity to the high-light               Prochlorococcus               ecotype. Distributions of NtcA and P-II in the Central Pacific Ocean were similar except at the Equator likely due to differential nitrogen stress responses between               Prochlorococcus               and               Synechococcus               .
