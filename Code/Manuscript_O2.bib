  abstract = {Even though light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, it can also be harmful to plants. Light-induced damage is targetted mainly to Photosystem II and leads to inactivation of electron transport and subsequent oxidative damage of the reaction centre, in particular to the D1 protein. Inactivation and protein damage can be induced by two different mechanisms, either from the acceptor side or from donor side of P680. The damaged D1 protein is triggered for degradation and digested by at least one serine-type proteinase that is tightly associated with the Photosystem II complex itself. The damaged Photosystem II complex dissociates from the light-harvesting antenna and migrates from appressed to non-appressed thylakoid regions where a new D1 protein is co-translationally inserted into the partially disassembled Photosystem II complex. D1 protein phosphorylation probably allows for coordinated biodegradation and biosynthesis of the D1 protein. After religation of cofactors and assembly of subunits, the repaired Photosystem II complex can again be found in the appressed membrane regions. Various protective mechanisms and an efficient repair cycle of Photosystem II allow plants to survive light stress.},

The proposed method relies on a control of the accuracy level, and imposes an improvement of function approximations when the accuracy is detected to be too low to proceed with the optimization process.

  abstract = {Although most phycologists use natural seawater for culturing marine species, artificial media continue to play important roles in overcoming problems of supply and seasonal variability in the quality of natural seawater and also for experiments involving manipulation of micro- and macronutrients. Several artificial media have been developed over the last 90 years; enriched seawater, artificial water (ESAW) is among the more popular recipes. ESAW has the advantage of an ionic balance that is somewhat closer to that of normal seawater. The original paper compared the growth of 83 strains of microalgae in natural seawater (ESNW) versus ESAW and determined that 23\% grew more poorly in the artificial water. Since 1980, however, the composition of ESAW, as used by the original authors, has changed considerably. In particular, the added forms of phosphate, iron, and silicate have been changed and the trace metal mixture has been altered to include nickel, molybdenum, and selenium. We tested whether these changes improved the ability of the artificial medium to grow previously difficult to grow phytoplankton species. To test this, we selected eight species that had been shown to grow better in ESNW than in ESAW and compared their growth again, using the currently used recipe with all the above modifications. For all but one species (Apedinella spinifera), growth rate and final yield was no different between the media but in one case (Emiliania huxleyi) was slightly higher in ESAW. No differences in cell morphology or volume were found in any case. We conclude that changes to the enrichment portion of the recipe have significantly improved this artificial seawater medium and that it can be used to grow an even wider range of coastal and open ocean species.},

These organisms are characterized by their small size and highly reduced genomes. Strains partition to different light intensity and nutrient level niches, with differing photosynthetic apparatus stoichiometry, light harvesting machinery and susceptibility to photoinactivation. In this study, we grew three strains of picocyanobacteria: the low light, high nutrient strain Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9313; the high light, low nutrient Prochlorococcus marinus MED 4; and the high light, high nutrient marine Synechococcus strain WH 8102; under low and high growth light levels. We then performed matched photophysiology, protein and transcript analyses. The strains differ significantly in their rates of Photosystem II repair under high light and in their capacity to remove the PsbA protein as the first step in the Photosystem II repair process. Notably, all strains remove the PsbD subunit at the same rate that they remove PsbA. When grown under low light, MIT 9313 loses active Photosystem II quickly when shifted to high light, but has no measurable capacity to remove PsbA. MED 4 and WH 8102 show less rapid loss of Photosystem II and considerable capacity to remove PsbA. MIT 9313 has less of the FtsH protease thought to be responsible for the removal of PsbA in other cyanobacteria. Furthermore, by transcript analysis the predominant FtsH isoform expressed in MIT 9313 is homologous to the FtsH 4 isoform characterized in the model strain Synechocystis PCC 6803, rather than the FtsH 2 and 3 isoforms thought to be responsible for PsbA degradation. MED 4 on the other hand shows high light inducible expression of the isoforms homologous to FtsH 2 and 3, consistent with its faster rate of PsbA removal. MIT 9313 has adapted to its low light environment by diverting resources away from Photosystem II content and repair.},

Phytoplankton function and acclimation are driven by catalytic protein complexes that mediate key physiological transformations, including generation of photosynthetic ATP and reductant, and carbon and nitrogen fixation. Quantitation of capacities for these processes allows estimation of rates for key ecosystem processes, and identification of factors limiting primary productivity. We herein present molar quantitations of PSI, PSII, ATP synthase, RuBisCO and the Fe protein of nitrogenase of Trichodesmium collected from the Gulf of Mexico, in comparison to determinations for a range of cyanobacteria growing in culture. Using these measurements, estimates were generated for Trichodesmium capacities for carbon fixation of 1-3.4 g C g chl a(-1) h(-1) and nitrogen fixation of 0.06-0.17 g N g chl a(-1) h(-1), with diel variations in capacities. ATP synthase levels show that ATP synthesis capacity is sufficient to support these levels of carbon and nitrogen fixation, and that ATP synthase levels change over the day in accordance with the ATP demands of nitrogenase and RuBisCO activity. Levels of measured complexes indicate that Trichodesmium manifests n-type diel light acclimation through rapid changes in RuBisCO:PSII, supported by significant investment of cellular nitrogen. The plasticity in the levels and stoichiometry of these core complexes show that changes in the abundance of core protein complexes are an important component of acclimation and regulation of metabolic function by Trichodesmium populations.},

  abstract = {Pangenomes offer detailed characterizations of core and accessory genes found in a set of closely related microbial genomes, generally by clustering genes based on sequence homology. In comparison, metagenomes facilitate highly resolved investigations of the relative distribution of microbial genomes and individual genes across environments through read recruitment analyses. Combining these complementary approaches can yield unique insights into the functional basis of microbial niche partitioning and fitness, however, advanced software solutions are lacking. Here we present an integrated analysis and visualization strategy that provides an interactive and reproducible framework to generate pangenomes and to study them in conjunction with metagenomes. To investigate its utility, we applied this strategy to a Prochlorococcus pangenome in the context of a large-scale marine metagenomic survey. The resulting Prochlorococcus metapangenome revealed remarkable differential abundance patterns between very closely related isolates that belonged to the same phylogenetic cluster and that differed by only a small number of gene clusters in the pangenome. While the relationships between these genomes based on gene clusters correlated with their environmental distribution patterns, phylogenetic analyses using marker genes or concatenated single-copy core genes did not recapitulate these patterns. The metapangenome also revealed a small set of core genes that mostly occurred in hypervariable genomic islands of the Prochlorococcus populations, which systematically lacked read recruitment from surface ocean metagenomes. Notably, these core gene clusters were all linked to sugar metabolism, suggesting potential benefits to Prochlorococcus from a high sequence diversity of sugar metabolism genes. The rapidly growing number of microbial genomes and increasing availability of environmental metagenomes provide new opportunities to investigate the functioning and the ecology of microbial populations, and metapangenomes can provide unique insights for any taxon and biome for which genomic and sufficiently deep metagenomic data are available.},

R., Rocap, G. \& Chisholm, S. W. (1998) Nature (London) 393, 464{\textendash}467]. However, the molecular basis of their physiological differences remained, so far, unexplained. In this paper, we show that the low-light-adapted Prochlorococcus strain SS120 possesses a gene family of seven transcribed genes encoding different Chl a/b-binding proteins (Pcbs). In contrast, Prochlorococcus sp. MED4, a high-light-adapted ecotype, possesses a single pcb gene. The presence of multiple antenna genes in another low-light ecotype (NATL2a), but not in another high-light ecotype (TAK9803{\textendash}2), is demonstrated. Thus, the multiplication of pcb genes appears as a key factor in the capacity of deep Prochlorococcus populations to survive at extremely low photon fluxes.},

We modulated electron transfer rate and light intensity independently of each other in lincomycin-treated pea leaves and in isolated thylakoids, in order to elucidate the specific effects of light and PSII electron transport on photoinhibition. Major changes in the rate of electron transport caused only small changes in the rate of photoinhibition, suggesting the existence of a significant photoinhibitory pathway that contains an electron-transfer-independent phase. We compared the action spectrum of photoinhibition with absorption spectra of PSII components that could function as photoreceptors of the electron-transfer-independent phase of photoinhibition and found that the absorption spectra of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) compounds resemble the action spectrum of photoinhibition, showing a steep decrease from UV-C to blue light and a low visible-light tail. Our results show that the release of a Mn ion to the thylakoid lumen is the earliest detectable step of both UV- and visible-light-induced photoinhibition. After Mn release from the oxygen-evolving complex, oxidative damage to the PSII reaction center occurs because the Mn-depleted oxygen-evolving complex cannot reduce P680+ normally.},

  abstract = {Within the vast oceanic gyres, a significant fraction of the total chlorophyll belongs to the light-harvesting antenna systems of a single genus, Prochlorococcus. This organism, discovered only about 10 years ago, is an extremely small, Chl b-containing cyanobacterium that sometimes constitutes up to 50\% of the photosynthetic biomass in the oceans. Various Prochlorococcus strains are known to have significantly different conditions for optimal growth and survival. Strains which dominate the surface waters, for example, have an irradiance optimum for photosynthesis of 200 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1, whereas those that dominate the deeper waters photosynthesize optimally at 30{\textendash}50 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These high and low light adapted `ecotypes' are very closely related {\textemdash} less than 3\% divergent in their 16S rRNA sequences {\textemdash} inviting speculation as to what features of their photosynthetic mechanisms might account for the differences in photosynthetic performance. Here, we compare information obtained from the complete genome sequences of two Prochlorococcus strains, with special emphasis on genes for the photosynthetic apparatus. These two strains, Prochlorococcus MED4 and MIT 9313, are representatives of high- and low-light adapted ecotypes, characterized by their low or high Chl b/a ratio, respectively. Both genomes appear to be significantly smaller (1700 and 2400 kbp) than those of other cyanobacteria, and the low-light-adapted strain has significantly more genes than its high light counterpart. In keeping with their comparative light-dependent physiologies, MED4 has many more genes encoding putative high-light-inducible proteins (HLIP) and photolyases to repair UV-induced DNA damage, whereas MIT 9313 possesses more genes associated with the photosynthetic apparatus. These include two pcb genes encoding Chl-binding proteins and a second copy of the gene psbA, encoding the Photosystem II reaction center protein D1. In addition, MIT 9313 contains a gene cluster to produce chromophorylated phycoerythrin. The latter represents an intermediate form between the phycobiliproteins of non-Chl b containing cyanobacteria and an extremely modified {$\beta$} phycoerythrin as the sole derivative of phycobiliproteins still present in MED4. Intriguing features found in both Prochlorococcus strains include a gene cluster for Rubisco and carboxysomal proteins that is likely of non-cyanobacterial origin and two genes for a putative {$E\epsilon\backslash$}varepsilon and {$\beta$} lycopene cyclase, respectively, explaining how Prochlorococcus may synthesize the {$\alpha$} branch of carotenoids that are common in green organisms but not in other cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Absorption spectrophotometry, a standard tool for quantitative analysis, suffers from two major drawbacks: lack of sensitivity and vulnerability to scattering. It has been pointed out earlier that the solution to these problems lies in using a reflecting cavity as a sample holder. Due to multiple reflections at the cavity wall, the effective pathlength becomes considerably larger than the diameter of the cavity, and scattering losses are eliminated because scattered light is prevented from escaping the detector. Though much effort has been spent in analysing and improving the performance of such a device, often called an integrating cavity absorption meter (ICAM), a simple strategy for deducing the absorbance of the sample is still lacking. It is shown here that the absorbance A{$\prime$} measured by using an ICAM exhibits a sublinear increase with the solute concentration C. The physical reason for this departure from linearity is explained, and a straightforward procedure for converting A{$\prime$} to the true absorbance A (proportional to C) is established. The reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by comparing the ICAM absorption spectrum of dilute dye solutions with the spectra of more concentrated solutions recorded in a conventional spectrophotometer. The ability of the device to cope with scattering was tested by filling the ICAM with a suspension of chloroplasts, and the spectrum was found, as expected, to be free from scattering artefacts.},

Here, we describe how the abundance of six known ecotypes, which have small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences that differ by less than 3\%, changed along local and basin-wide environmental gradients in the Atlantic Ocean. Temperature was significantly correlated with shifts in ecotype abundance, and laboratory experiments confirmed different temperature optima and tolerance ranges for cultured strains. Light, nutrients, and competitor abundances also appeared to play a role in shaping different distributions. Clades of the most common phytoplankton in the Atlantic Ocean are specialized for particular regions demarcated by temperature, light, and the presence of competitors.

  abstract = {The globally abundant marine Cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus share many physiological traits but presumably have different evolutionary histories and associated phylogeography. In Prochlorococcus, there is a clear phylogenetic hierarchy of ecotypes, whereas multiple Synechococcus clades have overlapping physiologies and environmental distributions. However, microbial traits are associated with different phylogenetic depths. Using this principle, we reclassified diversity at different phylogenetic levels and compared the phylogeography. We sequenced the genetic diversity of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus from 339 samples across the tropical Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean using a highly variable phylogenetic marker gene (rpoC1). We observed clear parallel niche distributions of ecotypes leading to high Pianka's Index values driven by distinct shifts at two transition points. The first transition point at 6{\textdegree}N distinguished ecotypes adapted to warm waters but separated by macronutrient content. At 39{\textdegree}N, ecotypes adapted to warm, low macronutrient vs. colder, high macronutrient waters shifted. Finally, we detected parallel vertical and regional single-nucleotide polymorphism microdiversity within clades from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, suggesting uniquely adapted populations at very specific depths, as well as between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Overall, this study demonstrates that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus have shared phylogenetic organization of traits and associated phylogeography.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph. Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct. All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light (LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates) and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution. There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes. They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction, to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene. Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes, helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus. Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles, especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core. Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the ``leaves of the tree,'' between the most closely related strains. Finally, the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and the wild.},

The presence of an oxygen-depleted layer at intermediate depths, which also impinges on the seafloor and in some cases the euphotic zone, plays a significant role in structuring both pelagic and benthic communities, and also in the vertical partitioning of microbial assemblages. Here, we assessed the genetic diversity and distribution of natural populations of the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus within oxic and suboxic waters of the eastern tropical Pacific using cloning and sequencing, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses applied to the 16S{\textendash}23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region. With the T-RFLP approach we could discriminate 19 cyanobacterial clades, of which 18 were present in the study region. Synechococcus was more abundant in the surface oxic waters of the eastern South Pacific, while Prochlorococcus dominated the subsurface low-oxygen waters. Two of the dominant clades in the oxygen-deficient waters belong to novel and yet uncultivated lineages of low-light adapted Prochlorococcus.},

  abstract = {Cultured isolates of Prochlorococcus from the Mediterranean Sea (MED4) and Sargasso Sea (SS120) have been shown to have dramatically different pigment composition and growth rate responses when grown over a range of irradiances. Moreover, analyses of field populations in the North Atlantic have shown that distinct ecotypes can coexist in the same water column. These and other observations have led to the hypothesis that Prochlorococcus is comprised of genetically distinct ecotypes that collectively expand the range of light intensities over which the genus can thrive. In this paper, we explore this hypothesis by comparing the photophysiology of 10 different Prochlorococcus isolates from diverse oceanographic regimes. We found that the 10 isolates could be grouped into two loose clusters based on their growth response to varying light intensity and their chlorophyll b/a2 (Chl b/a2) ratios. Although both groups photoacclimate when grown over a range of light intensities, isolates with distinctly higher Chl b/a2 ratios (high B/A ecotype) reach maximal growth rates at lower irradiances (Ik,g), have high growth efficiencies ({$\alpha$}g), and are inhibited in growth at irradiances where isolates with low Chl b/a2 ratios (low B/A ecotype) are growing maximally. High Chl b/a2 ratios resulted in higher spectrally weighted average Chl a2-specific absorption coefficient ({\=a}chl*), Chl a2 specific light-harvesting efficiency ({$\alpha$}chla), and quantum yield ({$\varphi$}m) under low growth irradiances for the isolates of the high B/A ecotype relative to the others. The distinction between the high and low B/A ecotypes is supported by molecular phylogenies constructed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. The physiological differences between the ecotypes most likely result in different relative distributions in a given water column and in fluctuations in their relative abundances as a function of seasonal dynamics and water-column stability.},

  abstract = {At 32 stations covering a wide variety of phytoplankton biomass, results have been obtained for in situ production, daily irradiation, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and spectral composition of submarine radiant energy. PAR is compared to the photosynthetically stored radiant energy (PSR), and a dimensionless quantity, {$\epsilon$}, describing the efficiency of the energy storage, is calculated. {$\epsilon$} varies from less than 0.01\% to about 0.1\% between the surface and the base of the euphotic layer in oligotrophic waters (Sargasso Sea). The corresponding values for productive waters (Mauritanian upwelling area) range between 0.1 and 0.8\%. On average, for the whole productive column, about 3\% ({$\pm$}1.5\%) of the total incident energy (including infra-red) is stored by photosynthesis per unit area of ocean per unit of chlorophyll (1 g Chl-a m-2), despite the variability of biomass (0.003 to 0.3 g Chl-a m-2). The photosynthetically usable radiant energy (PUR), i.e. the part of PAR that can be absorbed by algae, is evaluated. Comparison of PSR and PUR allows the estimation of the quantum yield {$\varphi$} and its variation with depth. The exact calculation of PUR requires the introduction of an effective absorption coefficient, aeff, for the living phytoplankton in its actual environment. The coefficient aeff must take into account both the algal absorption and the spectral composition of the remnant light. Low values obtained for PUR and the consequent excessive values for {$\varphi$} emphasize the necessity for chromatic adaptation, especially for an increase in accessory pigments absorbing green-yellow light.},

  abstract = {The marine picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus numerically dominate open ocean phytoplankton. Although evolutionarily related they are ecologically distinct, with different strategies to harvest, manage and exploit light. We grew representative strains of Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus and tracked their susceptibility to photoinactivation of Photosystem II under a range of light levels. As expected blue light provoked more rapid photoinactivation than did an equivalent level of red light. The previous growth light level altered the susceptibility of Synechococcus, but not Prochlorococcus, to this photoinactivation. We resolved a simple linear pattern when we expressed the yield of photoinactivation on the basis of photons delivered to Photosystem II photochemistry, plotted versus excitation pressure upon Photosystem II, the balance between excitation and downstream metabolism. A high excitation pressure increases the generation of reactive oxygen species, and thus increases the yield of photoinactivation of Photosystem II. Blue photons, however, retained a higher baseline photoinactivation across a wide range of excitation pressures. Our experiments thus uncovered the relative influences of the direct photoinactivation of Photosystem II by blue photons which dominates under low to moderate blue light, and photoinactivation as a side effect of reactive oxygen species which dominates under higher excitation pressure. Synechococcus enjoyed a positive metabolic return upon the repair or the synthesis of a Photosystem II, across the range of light levels we tested. In contrast Prochlorococcus only enjoyed a positive return upon synthesis of a Photosystem II up to 400 {$\mu$}mol photons m-2 s-1. These differential cost-benefits probably underlie the distinct photoacclimation strategies of the species.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) is the light-driven water:plastoquinone oxidoreductase of oxygenic photosynthesis and is found in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. Considerable attention is focused on how PSII is assembled in vivo and how it is repaired following irreversible damage by visible light (so-called photoinhibition). Understanding these processes might lead to the development of plants with improved growth characteristics especially under conditions of abiotic stress.Here we summarize recent results on the assembly and repair of PSII in cyanobacteria, which are excellent model organisms to study higher plant photosynthesis.Assembly of PSII is highly co-ordinated and proceeds through a number of distinct assembly intermediates. Associated with these assembly complexes are proteins that are not found in the final functional PSII complex. Structural information and possible functions are beginning to emerge for several of these `assembly' factors, notably Ycf48/Hcf136, Psb27 and Psb28. A number of other auxiliary proteins have been identified that appear to have evolved since the divergence of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The repair of PSII involves partial disassembly of the damaged complex, the selective replacement of the damaged sub-unit (predominantly the D1 sub-unit) by a newly synthesized copy, and reassembly. It is likely that chlorophyll released during the repair process is temporarily stored by small CAB-like proteins (SCPs). A model is proposed in which damaged D1 is removed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of two different types of FtsH sub-unit (FtsH2 and FtsH3), with degradation proceeding from the N-terminus of D1 in a highly processive reaction. It is postulated that a similar mechanism of D1 degradation also operates in chloroplasts. Deg proteases are not required for D1 degradation in Synechocystis 6803 but members of this protease family might play a supplementary role in D1 degradation in chloroplasts under extreme conditions.},

  abstract = {The minute photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorococcus, which was discovered about 10 years ago, has proven exceptional from several standpoints. Its tiny size (0.5 to 0.7 {$\mu$}m in diameter) makes it the smallest known photosynthetic organism. Its ubiquity within the 40{\textdegree}S to 40{\textdegree}N latitudinal band of oceans and its occurrence at high density from the surface down to depths of 200 m make it presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Prochlorococcus typically divides once a day in the subsurface layer of oligotrophic areas, where it dominates the photosynthetic biomass. It also possesses a remarkable pigment complement which includes divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl b, the so-called Chl a2 and Chl b2, and, in some strains, small amounts of a new type of phycoerythrin. Phylogenetically, Prochlorococcus has also proven fascinating. Recent studies suggest that it evolved from an ancestral cyanobacterium by reducing its cell and genome sizes and by recruiting a protein originally synthesized under conditions of iron depletion to build a reduced antenna system as a replacement for large phycobilisomes. Environmental constraints clearly played a predominant role in Prochlorococcus evolution. Its tiny size is an advantage for its adaptation to nutrient-deprived environments. Furthermore, genetically distinct ecotypes, with different antenna systems and ecophysiological characteristics, are present at depth and in surface waters. This vertical species variation has allowed Prochlorococcus to adapt to the natural light gradient occurring in the upper layer of oceans. The present review critically assesses the basic knowledge acquired about Prochlorococcus both in the ocean and in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {The marine unicellular cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the smallest-known oxygen-evolving autotroph1. It numerically dominates the phytoplankton in the tropical and subtropical oceans2,3, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. Here we compare the genomes of two Prochlorococcus strains that span the largest evolutionary distance within the Prochlorococcus lineage4 and that have different minimum, maximum and optimal light intensities for growth5. The high-light-adapted ecotype has the smallest genome (1,657,990 base pairs, 1,716 genes) of any known oxygenic phototroph, whereas the genome of its low-light-adapted counterpart is significantly larger, at 2,410,873 base pairs (2,275 genes). The comparative architectures of these two strains reveal dynamic genomes that are constantly changing in response to myriad selection pressures. Although the two strains have 1,350 genes in common, a significant number are not shared, and these have been differentially retained from the common ancestor, or acquired through duplication or lateral transfer. Some of these genes have obvious roles in determining the relative fitness of the ecotypes in response to key environmental variables, and hence in regulating their distribution and abundance in the oceans.},

We developed a quantitative proteomic method to directly assess nutrient stress in high-light ecotypes of the abundant cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus across a meridional transect in the central Pacific Ocean. Multiple peptide biomarkers detected widespread and overlapping regions of nutritional stress for nitrogen and phosphorus in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre and iron in the equatorial Pacific. Quantitative protein analyses demonstrated simultaneous stress for these nutrients at biome interfaces. This application of proteomic biomarkers to diagnose ocean metabolism demonstrated Prochlorococcus actively and simultaneously deploying multiple biochemical strategies for low-nutrient conditions in the oceans.},

  abstract = {Proteomics has great potential for studies of marine microbial biogeochemistry, yet high microbial diversity in many locales presents us with unique challenges. We addressed this challenge with a targeted metaproteomics workflow for NtcA and P-II, two nitrogen regulatory proteins, and demonstrated its application for cyanobacterial taxa within microbial samples from the Central Pacific Ocean. Using METATRYP, an open-source Python toolkit, we examined the number of shared (redundant) tryptic peptides in representative marine microbes, with the number of tryptic peptides shared between different species typically being 1\% or less. The related cyanobacteria               Prochlorococcus               and               Synechococcus               shared an average of 4.8 {$\pm$} 1.9\% of their tryptic peptides, while shared intraspecies peptides were higher, 13 {$\pm$} 15\% shared peptides between 12               Prochlorococcus               genomes. An NtcA peptide was found to target multiple cyanobacteria species, whereas a P-II peptide showed specificity to the high-light               Prochlorococcus               ecotype. Distributions of NtcA and P-II in the Central Pacific Ocean were similar except at the Equator likely due to differential nitrogen stress responses between               Prochlorococcus               and               Synechococcus               . The number of unique tryptic peptides coded for within three combined oceanic microbial metagenomes was estimated to be {$\sim$}4 {\texttimes} 10               7               , 1000-fold larger than an individual microbial proteome and 27-fold larger than the human proteome, yet still 20 orders of magnitude lower than the peptide diversity possible in all protein space, implying that peptide mapping algorithms should be able to withstand the added level of complexity in metaproteomic samples.},

We measured growth and photoinhibition of PSII in two low-light and one high-light Prochlorococcus strains and in one Synechococcus strain. All strains were found to be able to shortly utilize moderate or even high light, but the low-light strains bleached rapidly in moderate light. Measurements of photoinhibition in the presence of the antibiotic lincomycin showed that a low-light Prochlorococcus strain was more sensitive than a high-light strain and both were more sensitive than the marine Synechococcus. The action spectrum of photoinhibition showed an increase from blue to ultraviolet wavelengths in all strains, suggesting contribution of manganese absorption to photoinhibition, but blue light caused less photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than expected on the basis of earlier results from plants and cyanobacteria. The visible-light part of the action spectrum resembled the absorption spectrum of the organism, suggesting that photosynthetic antenna pigments, especially divinyl chlorophylls, have a more important role as photoreceptors of visible-light photoinhibition in marine cyanobacteria than in other photoautotrophs.},

  abstract = {The in situ community structure of Prochlorococcuspopulations in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean was examined by analysis of Prochlorococcus 16S rDNA sequences with three independent approaches: cloning and sequencing, hybridization to specific oligonucleotide probes, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The hybridization of high-light (HL) and low-light (LL) Prochlorococcus genotype-specific probes to two depth profiles of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA sequences revealed that in these two stratified water columns, an obvious niche-partitioning ofProchlorococcus genotypes occurred. In each water column a shift from the HL to the LL genotype was observed, a transition correlating with the depth of the surface mixed layer (SML). Only the HL genotype was found in the SML in each water column, whereas the LL genotype was distributed below the SML. The range of in situ irradiance to which each genotype was subjected within these distinct niches was consistent with growth irradiance studies of cultured HL- and LL-adapted Prochlorococcus strains. DGGE analysis and the sequencing of Prochlorococcus 16S rDNA clones were in full agreement with the genotype-specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization data. These observations of a partitioning ofProchlorococcus genotypes in a stratified water column provide a genetic basis for the dim and brightProchlorococcus populations observed in flow cytometric signatures in several oceanic provinces.},

This clade, named HNLC fell within the HL-adapted Prochlorococcus clade with sequences above 99\% similarity to one another, and was divided into two subclades, HNLC1 and HNLC2. The distribution of the whole HNLC clade in a northwest to southeast transect in the South Pacific (HNLC-to-gyre) and two 8{\textdegree}N to 8{\textdegree}S transects in the Equatorial Pacific was determined by quantitative PCR using specific primers targeting ITS regions. HNLC was the dominant HL Prochlorococcus clade (2{\textendash}9\% of bacterial 16S rRNA genes) at the three westernmost stations in the South Pacific but decreased to less than 0.1\% at the other stations being replaced by the eMIT9312 ecotype in the hyperoligotrophic gyre. The highest contributions of HNLC Prochlorococcus in both Equatorial Pacific transects along the latitudinal lines of 170{\textdegree}W and 155{\textdegree}W were observed at the southernmost stations, reaching 16 and 6\% of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, respectively, whereas eMIT9312 dominated near the Equator. Spearman Rank Order correlation analysis indicated that although both the HNLC clade and eMIT9312 were correlated with temperature, they showed different correlations with regard to nutrients. HNLC only showed significant correlations to ammonium uptake and regeneration rates, whereas eMIT9312 was negatively correlated with inorganic nutrients.},

  abstract = {In a focused analysis of Prochlorococcus population structure in the western North Atlantic, we found that the relative abundances of ecotypes varied significantly with depth and, at seasonally stratified locations, with degree of vertical mixing. More limited regional variation was observed (e.g., Sargasso Sea, Gulf Stream, continental slope, and equatorial current), and local patchiness was minimal. Modeling of a combined North and South Atlantic data set revealed significant, independent effects of light and temperature on ecotype abundances, suggesting that they are key ecological determinants that establish the different habitat ranges of the physiologically and genetically distinct ecotypes. This was in sharp contrast with the genus Synechococcus, whose total abundance was related to light but did not vary in a predictable way with temperature. Comparisons of field abundances with growth characteristics of cultured isolates of Prochlorococcus suggested the presence of ecotypespecific thermal and light adaptations that could be responsible for the distinct distribution patterns of the four dominant ecotypes. Significantly, we discovered that one ``low-light-adapted'' ecotype, eNATL2A, can thrive in deeply mixed surface layers, whereas another, eMIT9313, cannot, even though they have the same growth optimum for (low) light.},
