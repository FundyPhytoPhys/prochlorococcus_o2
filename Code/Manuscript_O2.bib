  abstract = {In this paper we consider large scale nonlinear least-squares problems for which function and gradient are evaluated with dynamic accuracy and propose a Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt method for solving such problems. More precisely, we consider the case in which the exact function to optimize is not available or its evaluation is computationally demanding, but approximations of it are available at any prescribed accuracy level. The proposed method relies on a control of the accuracy level, and imposes an improvement of function approximations when the accuracy is detected to be too low to proceed with the optimization process. We prove global and local convergence and complexity of our procedure and show encouraging numerical results on test problems arising in data assimilation and machine learning.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is the numerically dominant primary producer in open ocean ecosystems. Analysis of Prochlorococcus genome sequences from cultured isolates and ocean samples has broadened interest in studying this tiny cell, and efforts are underway to develop it into a model system for studying marine microbial ecology. A critical component of these efforts has been the development of systematic culturing methods that will facilitate the distribution of Prochlorococcus to diverse labs that may be interested in studying it. This paper provides detailed methods for maintaining cultures of Prochlorococcus, including a comparison of growth rates of cells on two artificial seawater media and on a standard medium that uses a natural seawater base. Procedures for agar plating, cryopreservation, obtaining new isolates, and issues associated with culture volume and carbon limitation also are described.},
